- **Export**: Download JSON backup anytime

### 📝 Personal Notes
- **Per Topic**: Each topic has a notes section
- **Auto-Save**: Notes saved on blur (when you click away)
- **Private**: Stored locally, never sent to server
- **Searchable**: Use browser search to find your notes

### 🗺️ Navigation
- **Sidebar**: Browse all topics by category
- **Search**: Find topics quickly (top right)
- **Breadcrumbs**: See where you are in the structure
- **Next/Previous**: Links at bottom of each page

### 🎨 Customization
- **Theme**: Toggle dark/light mode (top right)
- **Font Size**: Browser zoom works perfectly

## How to Learn

### Step 1: Choose Your Track
Three study tracks available:
- **Beginner**: 6 weeks (90 hours)
- **Standard**: 10 weeks (150 hours)
- **Deep Mastery**: 16 weeks (240 hours)

[View Study Tracks →](../tracks/overview.md)

### Step 2: Start with Part 1
Begin with **Core LLM & Transformer Fundamentals**:
1. Transformer Architecture
2. Attention Mechanisms
3. BERT vs GPT Model Families
4. Tokenization & Embeddings

### Step 3: Follow the Pattern
For each topic:
1. **Read** the blueprint (What/Why/When)
2. **Understand** the techniques
3. **Practice** with exercises
4. **Take notes** in the notes section
5. **Check off** when complete
6. **Move to next** topic

### Step 4: Complete Projects
Four mandatory hands-on projects:
- **Project 1**: Local RAG Q&A Bot (Weeks 2-3)
- **Project 2**: Conversational Agent (Weeks 4-6)
- **Project 3**: Multi-Agent System (Weeks 7-10)
- **Project 4**: Multimodal Capstone (Weeks 11-16)

## Progress Tracking Details

### Checkboxes
Each topic page has a checkbox at the top. Click it to mark complete.

**What Gets Saved**:
- Completion status (true/false)
- Completion timestamp
- Topic ID

**Where**: Browser localStorage (your device only)

### Notes
Each topic has a notes section at the bottom.

**How to Use**:
- Type your notes in the textarea
- Click away (blur event) to auto-save
- Notes persist across browser sessions

**Tips**:
- Summarize key concepts in your own words
- Save code snippets that worked
- Note questions to research later
- Link to external resources

### Dashboard
View your progress at any time:

**Stats Shown**:
- Overall progress percentage
- Days learning (since start)
- Topics completed this week
- Current streak (consecutive days)
- Progress by part (12 parts)
- Recently completed topics (last 5)

**Actions**:
- Export progress (JSON download)
- Reset all progress (careful!)

## Using AI Providers

### Claude (Anthropic)
**Best For**: Architecture, long context, explanations

**Example**:
> "Claude, explain transformer self-attention using an analogy."

### GPT/Codex (OpenAI)
**Best For**: Production code, debugging, optimization

**Example**:
> "Implement multi-head attention in PyTorch with detailed comments."

### Gemini (Google)
**Best For**: Search quality, scale patterns, evaluation

**Example**:
> "How does Google handle vector search at billion-doc scale?"

**Provider Icons**: Look for these on each topic page to see which AI excels.

## Study Tips

### 📅 Consistency
- **Daily habit**: Even 30 minutes helps
- **Track streaks**: Dashboard shows consecutive days
- **Weekly review**: Revisit notes every week

### 🛠️ Hands-On
- **Do all exercises**: They consolidate learning
- **Build real projects**: Portfolio-ready code
- **Experiment**: Try variations of examples

### 📝 Effective Notes
- **Summarize**: Use your own words
- **Examples**: Code snippets that worked
- **Questions**: Things to research later
- **Links**: Resources you found helpful

### 🤝 Use Community
- **Ask AI**: Claude, GPT, Gemini for help
- **Share**: Blog about your projects
- **Collaborate**: Study groups on Discord/Slack

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Search**: `/` or click search icon
- **Next Page**: Usually linked at bottom
- **Toggle Theme**: Click theme icon (top right)

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Saving?
**Check**: Not in private/incognito mode?
**Fix**: Use normal browsing mode

### Notes Disappearing?
**Check**: Did you clear browser data?
**Fix**: Export regularly as backup

### Page Not Loading?
**Check**: Check browser console for errors
**Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes! After first load, content is cached.

**Q: Can I print topics?**
A: Yes, use browser print (Ctrl+P).

**Q: Can I customize colors?**
A: Yes, edit `mkdocs.yml` and rebuild.

**Q: Can multiple people use this?**
A: Yes, but each needs their own browser profile.

**Q: How do I backup progress?**
A: Dashboard → "Export Progress" button.
