# Create Product Requirements Document

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this project.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the current project:**
   - Read existing code to understand what's been built
   - Identify core features already implemented
   - Understand the tech stack and architecture

2. **Interview the user (if needed):**
   - Ask clarifying questions about product vision
   - Understand target users and use cases
   - Clarify success metrics and goals

3. **Generate PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md:**
   - Use the template from `global-instructions/prd-pattern.md`
   - Fill in all sections based on project analysis
   - Include existing features in "Core Features"
   - Suggest logical next features for "Future Features"

4. **Provide immediate value:**
   - Identify any scope creep in current TODO.md
   - Flag features that should be prioritized higher
   - Suggest features that should be deferred

## Template Location

The complete PRD template is in: `global-instructions/prd-pattern.md`

## Output Format

Create `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` in the project root with:
- Product vision and user personas
- Core features (P0, P1, P2 prioritization)
- Future features (Phase 2, Phase 3)
- Technical constraints
- UX goals
- Non-goals (what we're NOT building)
- Success metrics
- Open questions and risks

## Deliverable

After creating the PRD:

1. ✅ Create `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` in project root
2. ✅ Provide a summary of:
   - Key insights about the product
   - Priority recommendations
   - Scope creep flags (if any)
   - Suggested next steps based on PRD

Remember: The PRD is a living document. You should reference it throughout development and update it as the product evolves.
