## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Data Collection (Parallel)

```
[Search Memory]
→ Query: "all decisions, projects, patterns, successes, failures"
→ Time range: Last 6 months
→ Focus: Patterns, not individual events

[Analyze Git History]
→ Command: git log --since="6 months ago" --oneline --stat
→ Check: Commit frequency, message quality, file patterns
→ Calculate: Features completed, bug fixes, refactors

[Review Configuration Files]
→ Read: CLAUDE.md, .mcp.json, global-instructions/*.md
→ Assess: Structure, completeness, sophistication
→ Compare: Against best practices

[Scan Project Structure]
→ Glob: *.md, README*, *.json
→ Assess: Organization, documentation, patterns
→ Identify: Strengths and gaps
```

### Step 2: Deep Analysis

**For each category:**
1. Gather evidence from data sources
2. Identify patterns (good and bad)
3. Compare against industry benchmarks
4. Assign rating with justification
5. Provide specific examples
6. Suggest improvements

### Step 3: Market Positioning Analysis

```
Compare against:
- Junior AI Engineer (0-2 years)
