   - Extract via Coveo JS:
     var e = document.querySelector("atomic-search-interface").engine;
     var total = e.state.search.response.totalCount;
     JSON.stringify({total: total, results: e.state.search.results.map(function(r){return {title: r.title, url: r.clickUri};})});
   - PAGINATE: If more pages exist, click Next, wait 3s, extract again

  IMPORTANT: You must capture ALL pages, not just the first 30 results.

    For each search:
    1. After extracting first page (30 results), check total count
    2. If totalCount > 30, click "Next" button or page 2
    3. Wait 3 seconds
    4. Extract again with Coveo JS
    5. Append to the same KB file
    6. Repeat until ALL pages captured

    Example: If total is 500 results = 17 pages (500/30). Extract all 17 pages.

    Coveo JS to check total:
    var e = document.querySelector("atomic-search-interface").engine;
    console.log("Total:", e.state.search.response.totalCount, "Current page results:", e.state.search.results.length);

    After clicking Next, extract and append to file. Continue until you've captured everything.
