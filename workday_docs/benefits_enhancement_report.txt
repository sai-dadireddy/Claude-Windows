================================================================================
KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

1. VALID ELECTRON COMMANDS ONLY
   ELIMINATED vague placeholders:
   X "fill required fields based on RAG guidance"
   X "[RAG data available but...]"
   X "complete standard workflow"

   ADDED specific commands:
   + "enter worker field as {WORKER_ID}"
   + "click button Search"
   + "verify table displays with columns: Plan Name, Coverage Type, Carrier"

2. SCREENSHOT NAMING CONVENTION
   All screenshots now use consistent naming:
   - {TEST_ID}_description.png for intermediate steps
   - {TEST_ID}_complete.png for final state
   - Example: BEN-1-0010_benefit_plans_page.png

3. PREREQUISITES ADDED
   Every test now includes:
   - Required user role (Benefits Administrator or HR Partner)
   - Test data requirements
   - Expected system state

4. API ALTERNATIVES DOCUMENTED
   Each test includes API options:
   - SOAP: Specific WSDL operations (e.g., Get_Benefit_Plans)
   - REST: API endpoints when available

5. VERIFICATION CRITERIA ENHANCED
   Replaced generic "nan" with specific checkboxes:
   - What data should appear
   - Expected calculations/values
   - Error-free completion

================================================================================
SAMPLE OUTPUT: BEN-1-0070 (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
================================================================================

TEST ID: BEN-1-0070
FUNCTIONAL AREA: Benefits
TEST NAME: Verify Worker Benefit Elections Details
CONFIDENCE: [HIGH] Score: 7.5/10
SOURCE: KB Article + RAG Enhancement

TASK/STEP: Extract Worker Benefit Elections Details

PREREQUISITES:
- User logged in with Benefits Administrator or HR Partner role
- Test data: Valid worker IDs and benefit plans configured

ELECTRON STEPS:
1. enter search box as "Worker Benefit Elections"
2. wait for search results
3. click search result containing "Worker Benefit Elections"
4. wait for page to load
5. enter worker field as "{WORKER_ID}"
6. click button "Search"
7. wait for worker details to load
8. screenshot as "BEN-1-0070_worker_elections.png"
9. verify election details display: Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, Retirement
10. verify coverage levels and costs are shown
11. screenshot as "BEN-1-0070_complete.png"

VERIFICATION:
- [ ] All benefit elections are displayed correctly
- [ ] Coverage amounts and costs match expected values
- [ ] Effective dates are accurate

NOTES:
- Enhanced using KB article: kb_benefits_enrollment.txt
- All steps are valid Electron commands
- Screenshots use test ID: BEN-1-0070
- Confidence score: 7.5/10 based on KB coverage

API ALTERNATIVE:
- SOAP: Get_Benefit_Plans, Get_Benefit_Elections (Benefits_Administration.wsdl)
- REST: /benefits/plans, /benefits/enrollments (if available)

================================================================================
KNOWLEDGE BASE SOURCES USED
================================================================================

1. kb_benefits_enrollment.txt - Primary source
   - 481 lines of detailed business process documentation
   - Covers enrollment workflows, plan types, dependents, beneficiaries
   - Includes field-level details and UI navigation

2. Workday RAG System - Secondary validation
   - 118 documents indexed (63 docs + 55 WSDLs)
   - 3,169 SOAP operations available
   - REST API schemas for modern integrations

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ENHANCEMENT
================================================================================

1. BROWSER-BASED KB SCRAPING (For Medium Confidence Files)
   To improve the 40 medium-confidence files:
   - Use Claude-in-Chrome to scrape Workday Community
   - Search for specific task documentation
   - Extract field names and workflow steps
   - Create new KB articles

2. SME REVIEW SESSIONS
   Schedule review with Benefits SMEs for:
   - ACA-related tasks (BEN-1-0120, BEN-1-0130)
   - Passive Events (BEN-2-0050, BEN-2-0060, BEN-2-0070)
   - Evidence of Insurability (BEN-2-0130, BEN-2-0140)
   - Cross-Plan Rules (BEN-2-0210, BEN-2-0220)

3. CREATE ADDITIONAL KB ARTICLES
   Priority areas for new KB documentation:
   - kb_benefits_aca.txt - Affordable Care Act configuration
   - kb_benefits_passive_events.txt - Automated benefit event processing
   - kb_benefits_evidence_insurability.txt - EOI workflow
   - kb_benefits_cross_plan_rules.txt - Multi-plan coordination

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Complete Remaining Files)
1. Process files 51-100 using same script
2. Process files 101-150
3. Continue until all 238 Benefits files are enhanced

SHORT-TERM (Week 1)
1. Create KB articles for medium-confidence tasks
2. Use browser scraping to gather missing documentation
3. Re-run enhancement script to boost confidence scores
4. Validate sample of high-confidence tests in actual Workday instance

MEDIUM-TERM (Week 2-4)
1. Extend to other functional areas (HCM, Payroll, Procurement)
2. Build domain-specific KB articles for each area
3. Create test data templates
4. Implement automated test execution framework
