================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT READINESS BY CONFIDENCE LEVEL
================================================================================

HIGH CONFIDENCE (50 tests) - READY TO DEPLOY ✅
- No additional review needed
- Can be deployed to ActiveGenie immediately
- Expected success rate: 80-90%

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (247 tests) - NEEDS REVIEW ⚠️
- Basic automation structure present
- Requires SME review for field-level accuracy
- Deploy after enhancement
- Expected success rate after review: 60-80%

LOW CONFIDENCE (92 tests) - MANUAL ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED ❌
- Generic steps only
- Requires manual test case development
- May need RAG query for additional context
- Not ready for deployment

MANUAL REQUIRED (24 tests) - CANNOT AUTOMATE ❌
- Missing critical data (Task/Step)
- Requires business analyst input
- Excel source data needs completion

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT PHASES
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Deploy HIGH Confidence (50 tests)
Timeline: Immediate
Risk: Low
Expected Issues: Minimal

Sample Tests to Deploy First:
- FACC-2-0010: Create Accounting Journal
- FACC-2-0020: Approve Journal
- FACC-2-0030: View Business Process for Accounting Journal
- FACC-2-0040: Unpost Accounting Journal
- FACC-1-0150: Confirm Account Posting Rules

PHASE 2: Review & Enhance MEDIUM Confidence (247 tests)
Timeline: 1-2 weeks
Process:
1. SME reviews generated steps
2. Add field-level details from tenant
3. Enhance verification criteria
4. Query RAG for missing information
5. Deploy in batches of 50

PHASE 3: Manual Development for LOW Confidence (92 tests)
Timeline: 2-4 weeks
Process:
1. Business analyst provides missing details
2. Query Workday RAG: python workday_rag.py "{task}"
3. Scrape Workday KB if needed
4. Manual test case development
5. Convert to Electron format

PHASE 4: Source Data Cleanup (24 MANUAL tests)
Timeline: Ongoing
Process:
1. Review Excel source data
2. Populate missing Task/Step fields
3. Regenerate tests
4. Deploy after validation

================================================================================
ENHANCEMENT OPTIONS
================================================================================

OPTION 1: RAG-Enhanced Generation
Command: python generate_finance_tests.py --with-rag
Benefit: Detailed field-level steps from KB articles
Time: ~2-3 hours (RAG queries for all 389 tests)
Output: Enhanced Electron steps with specific field names

OPTION 2: Manual SME Review
Process: Subject matter experts review MEDIUM confidence files
Benefit: Tenant-specific customization
Time: ~20-30 hours (247 tests)
Output: Production-ready test cases

OPTION 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
Process:
1. Deploy HIGH confidence immediately (50 tests)
2. RAG-enhance MEDIUM confidence (247 tests)
3. SME review RAG-enhanced tests
4. Manual development for LOW (92 tests)
Timeline: 2-3 weeks
Output: 297+ automated tests (HIGH + enhanced MEDIUM)

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. NO RAG QUERIES IN QUICK GENERATION
   - Current generation used pattern-based step creation
   - Did not query Workday RAG for field-level details
   - Recommendation: Run RAG-enhanced generation for critical tests

2. GENERIC FIELD PLACEHOLDERS
   - "fill required fields" used when specific fields unknown
   - "complete required actions" used for vague tasks
   - Recommendation: Replace with actual field names from tenant

3. VERIFICATION CRITERIA
   - Generic when Expected Result not provided in Excel
   - May need tenant-specific success criteria
   - Recommendation: Enhance with business-specific validations

4. WAIT TIMES
   - Generic "wait for page load" commands
   - May need adjustment based on tenant performance
   - Recommendation: Tune wait times during execution
