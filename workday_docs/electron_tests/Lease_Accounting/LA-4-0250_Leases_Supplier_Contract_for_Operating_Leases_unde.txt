TASK/STEP: Create Supplier Contract
NOTE: Task inferred from scenario description - original Excel Task/Step was null

DESCRIPTION:
Create a Supplier Contract for an Operating Lease configured for dual reporting
under two accounting standards: US GAAP (ASC 842) and IFRS 16.

Dual-standard reporting requires:
- Two book codes (one per standard)
- Potentially different lease classifications per standard
- Separate journal entries for each standard
- Reconciliation between GAAP and IFRS treatment

Key Differences between ASC 842 and IFRS 16:
| Aspect | ASC 842 (US GAAP) | IFRS 16 |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Operating Lease | Recognized (ROU + Liability) | All leases on balance sheet |
| Classification | Operating vs Finance | Single model (Finance-like) |
| Expense Pattern | Straight-line | Front-loaded (interest + depreciation) |

VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Supplier Contract is created with contract number
- [ ] Lease is associated with two book codes (ASC 842 and IFRS 16)
- [ ] ASC 842 ROU Asset is created with specified accounting method
- [ ] IFRS 16 ROU Asset is created with specified accounting method
- [ ] Separate Lease Liabilities recorded for each standard
- [ ] Payment schedule is generated for dual reporting
- [ ] Journal entries posted to both GAAP and IFRS ledgers
- [ ] Confirmation message displays successful submission

TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS:
- test_company: Company configured for dual-standard reporting
- test_supplier: Active supplier configured as lessor
- lease_commencement_date: Future or current date
- lease_end_date: Date > commencement date
- lease_term: Number of months (e.g., 36, 60, 120)
- asc842_book_code: Book code for US GAAP ASC 842
- asc842_rou_asset_class: Asset class for GAAP ROU assets
- asc842_accounting_method: Operating Expense or Depreciation Expense
- ifrs16_book_code: Book code for IFRS 16
- ifrs16_rou_asset_class: Asset class for IFRS ROU assets
- ifrs16_accounting_method: Depreciation Expense (IFRS always finance-like)
- monthly_payment: Lease payment amount
- first_payment_date: Date of first payment
- discount_rate_percent: Incremental borrowing rate

DUAL REPORTING CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Classification Differences:
   - ASC 842: May classify as Operating or Finance
   - IFRS 16: Essentially all leases treated as Finance

2. Expense Recognition:
   - ASC 842 Operating: Straight-line lease expense
   - IFRS 16: Interest expense + Depreciation expense (front-loaded)

3. Balance Sheet:
   - Both: ROU Asset and Lease Liability recognized
   - Amounts may differ due to discount rate/treatment
