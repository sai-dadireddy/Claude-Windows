TASK/STEP: Create Supplier Contract
NOTE: Task inferred from scenario description - original Excel Task/Step was null

DESCRIPTION:
Create a Supplier Contract for an Operating Lease using the ROU Asset Depreciation
Expense accounting method. This scenario configures the lease to report under
only one accounting standard (typically US GAAP ASC 842).

The ROU Asset Depreciation Expense method differs from Operating Expense method:
- ROU Asset is depreciated separately from lease liability amortization
- Depreciation expense and interest expense shown as separate line items
- More aligned with Finance Lease treatment on income statement
- Used when entity prefers to show asset depreciation explicitly

- Lease Book Code Configuration exists (see LA-1-0070)
- Supplier Contract Types configured for leases (see LA-1-0040)
