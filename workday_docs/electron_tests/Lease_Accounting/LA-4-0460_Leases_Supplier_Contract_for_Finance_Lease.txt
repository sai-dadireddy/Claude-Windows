TASK/STEP: Create Supplier Contract
NOTE: Task inferred from scenario description - original Excel Task/Step was null

DESCRIPTION:
Create a Supplier Contract for a Finance Lease. Finance leases recognize the
leased asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet, with separate
recognition of depreciation/amortization expense and interest expense.

FINANCE LEASE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA (ASC 842):
A lease is classified as Finance if ANY of these are met:
1. Transfer of ownership to lessee at end of lease term
2. Purchase option that lessee is reasonably certain to exercise
3. Lease term is major part of asset's remaining economic life (>= 75%)
4. Present value of payments is substantially all of asset's fair value (>= 90%)
5. Asset is specialized with no alternative use to lessor

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT:
- ROU Asset: Recorded at present value of lease payments + initial direct costs
- Lease Liability: Present value of future lease payments
- Amortization: ROU Asset depreciated over shorter of lease term or useful life
- Interest Expense: Calculated on declining lease liability balance
- Expense Pattern: Front-loaded (higher total expense in early periods)
