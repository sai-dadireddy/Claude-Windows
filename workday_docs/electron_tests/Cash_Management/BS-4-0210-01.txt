DESCRIPTION:
Create a payment return statement to record multiple payments that the bank rejected or returned to Workday. Workday creates items from the payment returns that you can reconcile against your bank statement.  Note that using the payment return statement method requires matching the recorded payment return with the payment, while manually returning payments does not.  Hit the Add button to add a Pending Payment Return.  Choose the Originating Bank Account, Return Amount, Return Payment ID (for matching to the bank statement) and Payment Return Date.  Hit OK
