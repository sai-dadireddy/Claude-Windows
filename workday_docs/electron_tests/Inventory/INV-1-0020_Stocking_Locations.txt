BUSINESS CONTEXT:
================================================================================
Stocking Locations are the physical storage units within Workday Inventory:

LOCATION TYPES:
1. Standard Locations: Regular bins, shelves, racks for general storage
2. Par Locations: Locations with min/max replenishment levels for auto-reorder
3. Par Bins: Sub-divisions within par locations for item segregation
4. Consigned Locations: Supplier-owned inventory stored on premises

KEY FEATURES:
- Hierarchical organization (zone > aisle > rack > bin)
- On Hold status prevents outbound transactions
- Lot tracking at location level for expiry management
- Serial number tracking for high-value items
- Consignment tracking for supplier-owned stock

COMMON OPERATIONS:
- Quick Issue: Issue items from stocking locations
- Put-Away: Stock items into stocking locations
- Inventory Move: Transfer items between locations
- Par Count: Count inventory at par locations
- Inventory Adjustment: Correct quantities at locations

================================================================================
NOTES:
================================================================================
- Each stocking location belongs to exactly one Inventory Site
- Location IDs must be unique within an Inventory Site
- On Hold locations cannot be used for issues until released
- Par Locations trigger replenishment when below minimum level
- Consigned locations track supplier ownership for invoicing
