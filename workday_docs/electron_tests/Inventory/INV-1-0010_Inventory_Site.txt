BUSINESS CONTEXT:
================================================================================
Inventory Sites are the foundation of Workday Inventory management. They:
1. Define physical locations where inventory is stored
2. Enable inventory transactions (receiving, put-away, picking, shipping)
3. Support consigned inventory management with suppliers
4. Allow site-specific sourcing rules for requisitions
5. Control inventory costing and accounting by company

Site Status Options:
- Active: Available for all spend transactions
- Restricted from Purchasing: Cannot add to POs but can fulfill from stock
- Inactive: Not available for new transactions

================================================================================
NOTES:
================================================================================
- Inventory Sites are a subset of Locations with inventory flag enabled
- Each site is associated with a single Company for accounting purposes
- Default Inventory Site can be configured at Company level
- Par Locations define reorder points within inventory sites
- Location Attributes control item-level settings per site
