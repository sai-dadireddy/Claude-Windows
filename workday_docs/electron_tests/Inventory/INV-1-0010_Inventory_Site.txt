DESCRIPTION:
Review and verify Inventory Site configuration in Workday. This task involves
accessing and validating the setup of inventory sites which are physical
locations where inventory is stored and managed.

WORKDAY ROLE: Inventory Manager / Supply Chain Administrator

PREREQUISITES:
- User logged in with Inventory Manager or Supply Chain Administrator permissions
- At least one Inventory Site must be configured in the system

[NEEDS SME REVIEW] - Insufficient KB coverage for specific field names and navigation paths.
RAG confidence: 5.0/10. The following steps are based on standard Workday report patterns
but require SME validation for accuracy.

ELECTRON STEPS:
1. enter search box as "Inventory Site"
2. wait for search results
3. click search result containing "Inventory Site"
4. wait for page to load
5. verify page title contains "Inventory Site"
6. screenshot as "INV-1-0010_report_page.png"
7. verify table or list view displays
8. screenshot as "INV-1-0010_complete.png"

VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Inventory Site report or configuration page loads successfully
- [ ] Data is displayed (sites list or configuration details)
- [ ] No error messages displayed
- [ ] User has appropriate access to view inventory sites

SME REVIEW REQUIRED FOR:
- [ ] Exact report/task name (is it "Inventory Site", "View Inventory Sites", or "Inventory Site Report"?)
- [ ] Specific field names and values to verify
- [ ] Whether this is a report view or configuration task
- [ ] Navigation path if not found via search
- [ ] Required data elements to validate

API ALTERNATIVE:
- SOAP: Resource_Management.wsdl - Contains inventory-related operations
- REST: Check Inventory or Supply Chain API schemas

NOTES:
- Current knowledge base lacks detailed Inventory Site documentation
- Recommend creating KB article after SME provides accurate steps
- May be related to Supply Chain Management module

RAG QUERY STATUS: LOW CONFIDENCE (Score: 5.0/10)
