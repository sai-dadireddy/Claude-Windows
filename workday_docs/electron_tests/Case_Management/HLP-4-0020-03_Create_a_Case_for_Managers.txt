================================================================================
VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

- [ ] Manager can access Create Case task
- [ ] Manager-specific Case Types are visible
- [ ] Case successfully created with confirmation
- [ ] Case Number displayed after submission
- [ ] Case routed to expected Service Team based on manager routing rules
- [ ] Service Team visible in case details
- [ ] No routing errors or unassigned status

================================================================================
TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS:
================================================================================

REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
- Service Category: [Must contain manager-specific Case Types]
- Case Type: [Manager-only type with routing rule - e.g., "Team Issue", "HR Manager Request"]
- Case Routing Rule: [Rule specific to manager Case Types]
- Service Team: [Expected destination team for manager cases]

EXPECTED ROUTING:
- Manager Case Type [X] -> Manager Support Service Team [Y]
- Example: "Team Performance Issue" -> "HR Manager Support Team"

NOTE: Manager Case Types may differ from Individual Contributor types.
Tester must identify Case Types available only to managers.

================================================================================
MANAGER VS INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR DIFFERENCES:
================================================================================

Managers typically have access to:
- Employee-related case types (about direct reports)
- Team management cases
- Manager HR requests
- Approval-related cases

Routing may differ:
- Manager cases often route to specialized support teams
- May have different SLA levels
- May require different security access for case workers

================================================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY EXPECTED ROUTING:
================================================================================

Before running test, admin should verify:

1. Search "Maintain Case Routing Rules"
2. Find rule for the manager-specific Case Type
3. Note the Service Team in the rule's "Route To" field
4. That is the expected outcome

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION METHOD:
================================================================================

If case details don't show Service Team to manager:

ADMIN VERIFICATION:
1. Login as Help Case Team member or admin
2. Search "Help Dashboard"
3. Find the case by Case Number
4. Verify "Service Team" assignment
5. screenshot as "HLP-4-0020-03_admin_verification.png"

================================================================================
ERROR SCENARIOS:
================================================================================

MANAGER CASE TYPES NOT VISIBLE:
- Verify Case Eligibility Rules for Manager role
- Check user has active manager assignment
- Verify user has direct reports

CASE NOT ROUTED:
- Verify Case Routing Rule exists for Case Type
- Check routing rule conditions are met
- Review "All Else Route To" fallback team

WRONG SERVICE TEAM:
- Check routing rule priority
- Verify manager-specific rules vs generic rules

================================================================================
API ALTERNATIVE:
================================================================================

REST API: Not available for Case Management (UI-only workflow)
SOAP API: No dedicated Help Desk WSDL
