VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

- [ ] Case successfully created with confirmation
- [ ] Case Number displayed after submission
- [ ] Case routed to expected Service Team based on Case Routing Rules
- [ ] Service Team visible in case details
- [ ] No routing errors or unassigned status

================================================================================
TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS:
================================================================================

REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
- Service Category: [e.g., "HR Services", "IT Support"]
- Case Type: [Must have Case Routing Rule configured]
- Case Routing Rule: [Rule that routes to specific Service Team]
- Service Team: [Expected destination team - verify in "Maintain Service Teams"]

EXPECTED ROUTING:
- Case Type [X] -> Service Team [Y]
- Example: "Payroll Question" -> "Payroll Support Team"

NOTE: Routing rules are tenant-specific. Tester must identify:
1. Which Case Type to use
2. What routing rule applies
3. Which Service Team should receive the case

================================================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY EXPECTED ROUTING:
================================================================================

Before running test, admin should verify:

1. Search "Maintain Case Routing Rules"
2. Find rule for the Case Type being tested
3. Note the Service Team in the rule's "Route To" field
4. That is the expected outcome

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION METHOD:
================================================================================

If case details don't show Service Team to employee:

ADMIN VERIFICATION:
1. Login as Help Case Team member or admin
2. Search "Help Dashboard"
3. Find the case by Case Number
4. Verify "Service Team" assignment
5. screenshot as "HLP-4-0010-04_admin_verification.png"

================================================================================
ERROR SCENARIOS:
================================================================================

CASE NOT ROUTED (Unassigned):
- Verify Case Routing Rule exists for Case Type
- Check routing rule conditions are met
- Review "All Else Route To" fallback team

WRONG SERVICE TEAM:
- Check routing rule priority (lower number = higher priority)
- Verify routing rule conditions match case data
- Review multiple routing rules that may apply

================================================================================
API ALTERNATIVE:
================================================================================

REST API: Not available for Case Management (UI-only workflow)
SOAP API: No dedicated Help Desk WSDL - managed through UI configuration

To verify routing programmatically, use Workday Report:
- Create custom report on Cases
- Include Service Team field
- Filter by Case Number
