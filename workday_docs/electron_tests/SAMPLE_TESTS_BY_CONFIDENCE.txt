[XX] MANUAL - DATA MANAGEMENT EXAMPLE (< 5.0)
================================================================================

FILE: Data_Management_FIN/PLNF-2-0010.txt

TEST ID: PLNF-2-0010
FUNCTIONAL AREA: PLN - Data Management (FIN)
TEST NAME: Run Task - Accounts
CONFIDENCE SCORE: 4.0/10
STATUS: [XX] MANUAL

DESCRIPTION:
Confirm that Accounts task(s) successfully run

TASK/STEP:
-Go to Integration > Run Tasks
-Run all tasks related to the creation of accounts
-Confirm that the task successfully completes at %100
-Confirm the the correct accounts have been created in the correct hierarchy.
-Confirm that the expected naming conventions are used.

ELECTRON STEPS:
1. [MANUAL REQUIRED - Insufficient KB coverage]
2. Confidence Score: 4.0/10
3.
4. RAG Results:
5. (RAG returned HCM-related results, not Integration module)

VERIFICATION:
- [ ] No error messages displayed

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE SCORING BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

For the THREE generated areas:

ADVANCED COMPENSATION (111+ tests):
  - [OK] ACCEPTED (>= 7.0): ~40-50 tests (estimated)
  - [!!] NEEDS REVIEW (5-6.9): ~30-40 tests (estimated)
  - [XX] MANUAL (< 5.0): ~20-30 tests (estimated)

  Common ACCEPTED scenarios:
    - Plan Security verification
    - Worker profile navigation
    - Simple verification tasks

  Common MANUAL scenarios:
    - Complex plan configuration
    - Multi-criteria validation
    - Advanced setup tasks

DATA MANAGEMENT - FIN (16 tests):
  - [OK] ACCEPTED (>= 7.0): 0-2 tests (estimated)
  - [!!] NEEDS REVIEW (5-6.9): 0-2 tests (estimated)
  - [XX] MANUAL (< 5.0): 12-16 tests (estimated)

  Reason for low confidence:
    - Integration module not in KB
    - Technical/administrative focus
    - Requires specialized documentation

DATA MANAGEMENT - HCM (16 tests):
  - [OK] ACCEPTED (>= 7.0): 0-2 tests (estimated)
  - [!!] NEEDS REVIEW (5-6.9): 0-2 tests (estimated)
  - [XX] MANUAL (< 5.0): 12-16 tests (estimated)

  Same pattern as FIN - Integration module KB gap

================================================================================
WHAT MAKES A HIGH CONFIDENCE TEST?
================================================================================

Characteristics of [OK] ACCEPTED tests (>= 7.0):

1. CLEAR NAVIGATION PATH
   - Specific menu or search term
   - Defined click target
   - Example: "Navigate to worker profile"

2. SIMPLE VERIFICATION
   - Visual confirmation needed
   - Example: "Ensure target is not visible"

3. RAG COVERAGE
   - Similar scenarios exist in KB
   - Field names documented
   - Business process documented

4. MINIMAL COMPLEXITY
   - 3-5 Electron steps
   - Linear workflow
   - No complex branching logic

================================================================================
WHAT CAUSES LOW CONFIDENCE?
================================================================================

Characteristics of [XX] MANUAL tests (< 5.0):

1. KB COVERAGE GAP
   - No relevant documentation in RAG
   - New or specialized module (e.g., Integration)
   - Score < 5.0 from RAG similarity

2. COMPLEX CONFIGURATION
   - Multiple criteria to verify
   - Example: 8 different settings to check
   - Requires specific field names

3. TECHNICAL/ADMINISTRATIVE
   - Backend tasks (Run Tasks, Data Loads)
   - Not typical user workflows
   - Integration/system tasks

4. AMBIGUOUS STEPS
   - Vague task description
   - "Complete required fields" without specifics
   - No clear navigation path

================================================================================
HOW TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE SCORES
================================================================================

TO ELEVATE MANUAL → REVIEW (4.0 → 6.0):
  1. Add basic KB article for the module
  2. Document navigation path
  3. List common field names
  4. Re-run generator

TO ELEVATE REVIEW → ACCEPTED (6.0 → 8.0):
  1. SME validates generated steps
  2. Add specific field names to KB
  3. Document exact UI element names
  4. Update RAG index
  5. Re-run generator

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
  1. Data Management shows 4.0 confidence
  2. Create kb_integration_run_tasks.txt:
     - Document "Integration > Run Tasks" navigation
     - List task types (Accounts, Levels, Dimensions)
     - Define completion criteria
  3. Rebuild RAG index
  4. Re-run gen_three_areas.py
  5. Expected new confidence: 6.0-7.0

================================================================================
USAGE IN ACTIVEGENIE
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE USE (No modification):
  - All [OK] ACCEPTED tests (>= 7.0)
  - Estimated: 40-50 tests from Advanced Compensation

MINOR MODIFICATION (SME review):
  - All [!!] NEEDS REVIEW tests (5-6.9)
  - SME adds specific field names
  - Estimated: 30-40 tests

REQUIRES CREATION (Use as template):
  - All [XX] MANUAL tests (< 5.0)
  - Use description and task as starting point
  - Build steps manually
  - Estimated: 40-50 tests

================================================================================
ELECTRON COMMAND REFERENCE
================================================================================

Commands used in HIGH CONFIDENCE tests:

NAVIGATION:
  navigate to "{path or description}"
  enter search box as "{search_term}"

NOT USED (Invalid):
  - Generic placeholders: "[complete required fields]"
  - Invented commands: "[follow standard flow]"
  - Ambiguous references: "[click next]"

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. REVIEW SAMPLES:
   - Read high-confidence tests: Advanced_Compensation/ACM-1-0020.txt
   - Review manual tests: Advanced_Compensation/ACM-1-0010.txt
   - Compare with original Excel scenarios

2. VALIDATE IN ACTIVEGENIE:
   - Import 5 high-confidence tests
   - Execute in test environment
   - Confirm Electron commands work as expected

3. ENHANCE KB:
   - Create kb_integration_run_tasks.txt
   - Create kb_compensation_plan_config.txt
   - Scrape Workday Community for missing topics

4. RE-GENERATE:
   - After KB enhancement
   - Expected improvement: +20-30% acceptance rate
   - Target: 70%+ ACCEPTED for Advanced Compensation

5. SME REVIEW:
   - Schedule session for NEEDS REVIEW tests
   - Focus on field name validation
   - Update tests to ACCEPTED
