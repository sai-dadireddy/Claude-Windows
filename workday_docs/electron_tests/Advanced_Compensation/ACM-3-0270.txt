DESCRIPTION:
Log into Workday as a Compensation Administrator and start a rollout process for Merit, Bonus, and Stock Plans (separately or in any combination, it's important to run several processes). This process allows you to assign Compensation Plans to multiple employees without approval steps. Make sure the Effective Date is aligned with the Compensation Review Process you are going to initiate. Note: if an employee was not eligible (e.g. not yet hired) for the plan on the effective date of the rollout, they will not receive the plan assignment. Compensation rollouts should only be used if every worker should receive the plan as of the same effective date.  If unique effective dates are necessary, then opt for assigning plans via EIB.
