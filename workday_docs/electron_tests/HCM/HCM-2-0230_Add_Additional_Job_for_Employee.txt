TEST ID: HCM-2-0230
FUNCTIONAL AREA: HCM
TEST NAME: Add Additional Job for Employee
CONFIDENCE: [HIGH] Score: 7.0/10
SOURCE: [RAG]
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:
Using open positions created above, initiate an add job process for an existing employee who currently holds only one position. Select the supervisory organization for the additional job and the employee. After selecting the supervisory organization, employees currently in that organization will display in the employee drop down, but it is possible to select an employee from another organization. Specify the effective date and reason, validating reason setup and visibility, and complete additional required details. Note: Workday automatically populates many of these fields with values defined on the position or job requisition; if you use job requisitions, you can't change those values and must update the job requisition itself. Verify that the compensation package, grade and/or grade profile, and appropriate base pay plan default into the compensation sub-process. Take note of approval routings and notifications as applicable, and confirm process. After successfully completing the process, verify the employee is in both positions. If the additional position reports to a different Manager and/or HR Partner, verify that position access is restricted as expected.
