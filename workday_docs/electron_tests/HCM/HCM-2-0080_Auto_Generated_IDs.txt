VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Sequence Generator task accessible
- [ ] Worker ID sequence configured correctly
- [ ] Position ID sequence configured correctly
- [ ] Job Requisition ID sequence configured (if applicable)
- [ ] IDs increment sequentially without gaps
- [ ] ID format matches configured prefix and length
- [ ] Recently created positions have correct ID format
- [ ] Recently hired workers have correct ID format
- [ ] No duplicate IDs exist
- [ ] No error messages displayed

SEQUENCE TYPES TO VERIFY:
- Worker ID (Employee Number): Format typically "E" + 5-6 digits
- Position ID: Format typically "P-" + 6 digits or organization prefix
- Job Requisition ID: Format typically "JR-" + year + sequence
- Applicant ID: Format typically "A" + 6 digits
- Pre-Hire ID: Format typically "PH" + 6 digits

FIELD REFERENCE:
- Sequence Name: Identifies the ID type
- Prefix: Text that appears before the number
- Next Value: Current counter value
- Increment: Step value (usually 1)
- Minimum/Maximum: Range constraints
- Pad Character: Leading character (usually 0)
- Length: Total digits in sequence number

ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION:
1. enter search box as "{recently_created_position_id}"
2. wait for search results
3. click search result containing "{recently_created_position_id}"
4. wait for page to load
5. verify position details display correctly
6. note Position ID format
7. enter search box as "{recently_hired_worker_id}"
8. wait for search results
9. click search result containing "{recently_hired_worker_id}"
10. wait for page to load
11. verify worker profile displays correctly
12. note Worker ID format

API ALTERNATIVE:
- SOAP: Human_Resources.Get_Workers (returns Worker_ID)
- SOAP: Staffing.Get_Positions (returns Position_ID)
- REST: /workers (includes employee number)
- REST: /positions (includes position ID)

COMMON ID FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- Worker ID: "E100001", "100001", "EMP-100001"
- Position ID: "P-000001", "POS100001", "HQ-P-000001"
- Job Requisition: "JR-2025-001", "REQ100001"

ERROR HANDLING:
- "Sequence not found": Verify sequence generator name
- "Access denied": User needs setup administrator access
- "Duplicate ID": Sequence may have conflicts, investigate
