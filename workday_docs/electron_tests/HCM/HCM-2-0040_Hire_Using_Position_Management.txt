CONFIDENCE: [HIGH] Score: 7.0/10
SOURCE: [RAG]

DESCRIPTION:
Using open positions created above, hire an employee that has not yet been created as a pre-hire (create the pre-hire as part of the hire process). Note that at least one piece of contact information is required to be able to save the pre-hire. Complete multiple hires for: current date, future date and past date. Use each of the recommended security groups listed to initiate the hire process. Verify that the working hours default as expected based on working time configuration. Verify that the compensation package, grade and/or grade profile, and appropriate base pay plan default into the compensation sub-process. Take note of the approval routings (especially when using different initiators) and sub-processes that are a part of the hire process. If you have enabled the consolidated Hire Process verify all tasks for hire are consolidated for the initiator. View new hire successfully created and the notice inability to view future dated hire as of current date.
