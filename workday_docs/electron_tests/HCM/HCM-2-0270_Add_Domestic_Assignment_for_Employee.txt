DESCRIPTION:
Based on your tenant configuration for Domestic and International Assignments, using open positions created in the same country location as the "home" position, initiate the Domestic Assignments process for an existing employee who currently holds only one "home" position. Select the supervisory organization for the Domestic Assignment and the employee. After selecting the supervisory organization, employees currently in that organization will display in the employee drop down, but it is possible to select an employee from another organization. Specify the effective date and reason, validating reason setup and visibility, and complete additional required details. 
After successfully completing the process, go to the worker profile and select Job and then the Jobs tab, and verify the employee is in both the home position (position prior to the start date of the assignment) and host position (position of the employee during the assignment). If the additional position reports to a different Manager and/or HR Partner, verify that position access is restricted as expected.
