DESCRIPTION:
Initiate an end job process for an employee with multiple positions. Select the employee and the job. Complete the end job details, validating reason setup and visibility. If you didn’t close the position, Workday sets its status to open. If you use job requisitions, the position is available as soon as you have an open requisition. If you don’t use job requisitions, the position is available the next day. Take note of approval routings and notifications as applicable, and confirm process. After successfully completing the process, verify the employee is no longer in the additional position. If the additional position reported to a different Manager and/or HR Partner, verify that position access to the remaining position(s) is restricted as expected.
