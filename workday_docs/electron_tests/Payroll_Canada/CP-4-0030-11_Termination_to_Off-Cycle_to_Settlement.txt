DESCRIPTION:
Launch the ROE integration to generate the ROE file. Review the file to make sure it meets requirements.  NOTE: Services Canada does have a test facility on their website and the files out of and into WD can be tested with minor manual adjustments to the file (to use dummy data rather than real personal info). It is strongly encouraged that a customer test both the inbound and outbound integration in E2E testing and NOT wait until in Production.
