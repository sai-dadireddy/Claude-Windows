## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/attachments)Attachments

Use the attachments API to create, update, and delete the attachments in Workday Strategic Sourcing.

## [](#tag/attachments/Working-with-Attachments)Working with Attachments

Creating attachments for Workday Strategic Sourcing objects is a two-step process. First, you need to inform the system about your intention to upload an attachment by issuing a "Create an Attachment" request, consisting of the file name and a link to the object to which you are adding an attachment. The link is represented by a relationship object containing an object ID and its type.

In the response you will receive a link in the `upload_url` attributes, along with required HTTP headers to send with your file. You will need to upload your file as a binary stream in a PUT request into the specified URL, making sure the required headers are present. Here is how the workflow might look like when triggered from a console:

```bash
$ curl -H "X-Api-Key: ${COMPANY_KEY}" \
       -H "X-User-Token: ${USER_TOKEN}" \
       -H "X-User-Email: ${USER_EMAIL}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
       -X POST \
       -d '
         {
           "data": {
             "type": "attachments",
             "attributes": {
               "title": "My Interesting Document",
               "file_name": "Some Interesting File.pdf"
             },
             "relationships": {
               "contract": {
                 "data": {
                   "id": 1,
                   "type": "contracts"
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       ' \
       "https://api.us.workdayspend.com/services/attachments/v1/attachments"

{
    "data": {
        "id": "1",
        "type": "attachments",
        "attributes": {
            "title": "My Interesting Document",
            "file_size": null,
            "upload_url": "https://upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/contract/1/hex/file.pdf?some=very&long=url",
            "upload_headers": [
                {
                    "name": "Content-Type",
                    "value": "application/octet-stream"
                },
                {
                    "name": "x-amz-acl",
                    "value": "private"
                },
                {
                    "name": "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
                    "value": "AES256"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Content-Disposition",
                    "value": "attachment"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

$ curl -X PUT \
    --data "@file.pdf" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    -H "x-amz-acl: private" \
    -H "x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256" \
    -H "Content-Disposition: attachment" \
    https://upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/contract/1/hex/file.pdf?some=very&long=url
```

The upload URL expires within 15 minutes after issuing. Please note that you will not be able to upload the data file to the attachment object after that. An automated system will purge all partial uploads after a certain period (usually within 30-60 minutes after creation) to prevent orphan records from overflowing the system.

**Please Note**: The list of headers and their values might change at any time, so when you're implementing an integration with the Workday Strategic Sourcing system, make sure to include all of the HTTP headers returned from the attachments endpoint.

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.1`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/contracts)Contracts

## [](#tag/contracts/operation/List Contracts)List Contracts

Returns a list of contracts for the specified criteria.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

filter

object (ContractInputFilter)

Filter contracts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

include

string (ContractRelatedResources)

Enum: "contract\_type" "spend\_category" "supplier\_company" "docusign\_envelopes" "adobe\_sign\_agreements"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/contracts?include=contract_type,supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and full related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes`, `links`, and potentially `relationships`).

page

object (PageInput)

Customize pagination results with `size`.

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.2`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

Copy

`null`

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/events)Events

Use the events API to create, update, and query the events in Workday Strategic Sourcing.

## [](#tag/events/Event-Object)Event Object

## [](#tag/events/operation/Create an Event)Create an Event

Events can only be created from a template. When a creation request is issued, the base event object will be created from the template and returned with the response. Child records such as attachments, price sheets and custom values, will be scheduled for copy asynchronously. Current duplication status can be retrieved from the `duplication_state` attribute, which will have one of following values:

-   `scheduled` - duplication is scheduled, but not yet started;
-   `started` - duplication started, but not yet finished;
-   `finished` - duplication completed;
-   `failed` - there was an error duplicating relationships.

An event should always have an associated project. Please make sure to specify it as a relationship object.

A new event will automatically inherit its spend category from the event template.

Please note, this endpoint does not support auction creation/duplication.

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/field_groups)Field Groups

Use the fields API to create, update, and query the custom fields groups in Workday Strategic Sourcing. Custom field groups act as a collection of custom fields. Every newly made custom field with requires a custom field group (except for the fields with `target_object` set to `RFP`).

## [](#tag/field_groups/Field-Group-Object)Field Group Object

type

required

string (FieldGroupType)

Object type, should always be `field_groups`.

id

required

integer (FieldGroupId)

Field group identifier string.

attributes

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

Copy

`null`

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/projects)Projects

Use the projects API to create, update, and query the projects in Workday Strategic Sourcing.

## [](#tag/projects/Project-Object)Project Object

type

required

string (ProjectType)

Object type, should always be `projects`.

id

required

integer (ProjectId)

Project identifier string.

attributes

object (ProjectAttributes)

# Workday Strategic Sourcing Reports API (1.0)

Download OpenAPI specification:[Download](blob:https://apidocs.workdayspend.com/861bfd72-7f25-48a1-92e5-7bfa59de931f)

## [](#tag/support)Customer Support

We've provided detailed documentation below to guide you. However, if you need additional assistance, here's how you can get the support you need:

-   **Community Discussions:** Join the conversation on our Workday Community Discussion Boards (found under the "Collaborate" section in community). Connect with other users, share best practices, and get answers to your configuration questions.
-   **Expert Configuration Assistance (Professional Services):** For tailored, hands-on support with your specific project, our Professional Services team is available.
    -   Looking for personalized guidance? Workday Success Plan customers can submit an "Ask" for expert insights on configuration and best practices.
    -   Need custom solutions? Consider Expert Assist, our consulting service for detailed changes and project support.
-   **Reporting System Issues:** If you suspect a problem with the Workday system itself, please connect with our dedicated support team. Your company's Named Support Contact (NSC) can log a Product Support Defect case. We'll review the issue based on its impact and Workday's service level agreement (SLA).

## [](#tag/servers)Servers

A corresponding "region domain" should be used on every request. Please contact customer support if you are not sure which one to use.

**Note, our original domain `api.scoutrfp.com` is currently deprecated. Please switch to a new US region domain on or before April-2025.**

Region

Domain

**US (Default)**

[https://api.us.workdayspend.com](https://api.us.workdayspend.com)

**Canada**

[https://api.ca.workdayspend.com](https://api.ca.workdayspend.com)

**Europe/EU**

[https://api.eu.workdayspend.com](https://api.eu.workdayspend.com)

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit _for reporting only_ is 1 request per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/versioning)Versioning

**Note**: The Reporting API handles versioning differently than our public APIs.

We release a new dated version when we make backwards incompatible changes to the API. So to be sure that the version used is consistent, we require it to be supplied in the request Accept header mime type `com.workdayspend.api.version` parameter.

As the JSON API spec requires to supply its mime type [at least once with no parameters](https://jsonapi.org/format/#content-negotiation-clients), the recommended way is to supply the Accept header as follows:

```
  application/vnd.api+json,application/vnd.api+json; com.workdayspend.api.version=2019-01-01
```

The next Accept header will be deprecated in April-2025:

```
  application/vnd.api+json,application/vnd.api+json; com.scoutrfp.api.version=2019-01-01
```

where `2019-01-01` is the current version.

There is `2018-04-01` version still available, which allows to pass given report id as a parameter (See 2018-04-01 Projects or Events documentation), however it might be depricated without a warning.

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

The list endpoints are paginated - the records are returned in batches of 10 by default. You can change this amount by passing the page\[size\] parameter that supports values from 1 to 100. If the previous/next page is available for the requested records, the `prev`/`next` key respectively has a value with a link to the corresponding page in the top level `links` object of the response. Otherwise, if the next/previous page is not available, the value for the corresponding key is `null`. So normally you would fetch the record with the standard URL and repeatedly fetch the next page till it is not available any more (which means that you have fetched all the pages).

## [](#tag/sorting)Sorting

The results of each list endpoint are sorted by its default sort value. You can override the sort value by passing the `sort` param to the request. Default and available values are visible in the documentation list endpoint section of each resource.

## [](#tag/including_relationships)Including Relationships

By default only the `id` and `type` of record relationships will be included. To include other attributes in the response, use the `include` parameter with a single value or multiple comma-separated values. An array of relationship objects is then available under the top level `included` key. Valid `include` values are noted in the documentation endpoint section of each resource.

## [](#tag/contract_milestone_reports)Contract Milestone Reports

This report returns a list of contract milestone report entries.

## [](#tag/contract_milestone_reports/operation/Contract Milestone Report Entries)Contract Milestone Report Entries

Returns a list of milestone report entries.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/limitation)Support & Limitation

**The SCIM endpoints are limited to companies with SSO authentication only.**

Requests coming from companies without SSO configured will get a `403 Access forbidden` response.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing SCIM API uses a combination of HTTP basic authentication and a company token to authenticate requests. Every request will require 2 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**Authorization**

[HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) of: user email and user- API token

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

### Example 1

```
curl --request GET 'https://api.us.workdayspend.com/scim/v2/ResourceTypes' \
--header 'Accept: application/scim+json' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: ${COMPANY_KEY}' \
--user "${USER_EMAIL}:${USER_TOKEN}"
```

### Example 2

```
curl --request GET 'https://api.us.workdayspend.com/scim/v2/ResourceTypes' \
--header 'Accept: application/scim+json' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: ${COMPANY_KEY}' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ${Base64(USER_EMAIL:USER_TOKEN)}'
```

### Example 3

```
curl --request GET 'https://${USER_EMAIL}:${USER_TOKEN}@api.us.workdayspend.com/scim/v2/ResourceTypes' \
--header 'Accept: application/scim+json' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: ${COMPANY_KEY}'
```

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The current rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/user/operation/Replace a User)Replace a User

Updates a User resource (see [section 3.5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.1) of RFC 7644). Update works in a replacement fashion; every attribute value found in the payload sent will replace the one in the existing resource representation. Attributes not passed in the payload will be left intact.

If the user tries to deactivate themselves, they will get a `403 Access forbidden` response.

Operations on the `userName` field will only be processed if both original and target email addresses match the domains list set for the Company's SSO connections.

If not, the response returned will be a `403 Access forbidden`.

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

Copy

`null`

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/spend_categories)Spend Categories

Use the Spend Categories API to create, update, and query the Spend Categories in Workday Strategic Sourcing.

Spend Categories are used in both the project and contract resources. On POST and PATCH related endpoints for those resources a spend\_category\_id can be added to attach a spend category. The spend\_category\_id is a foreign key for the spend\_categories resource's id.

## [](#tag/spend_categories/Spend-Category-Object)Spend Category Object

type

string (SpendCategoryType)

Object type, should always be `spend_categories`.

id

required

integer (SpendCategoryId)

Spend category identifier string.

attributes

object (SpendCategoryAttributes)

Spend category attributes.

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

The current version of this service is indicated by the `X-Api-Version` header.

Sample version header: `X-Api-Version: 1.0`.

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/supplier_companies/operation/List Supplier Companies)List Supplier Companies

Returns a list of supplier companies for the specified criteria.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

filter

object (SupplierCompanyInputFilter)

Filter supplier companies by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

include

string (SupplierCompanyRelatedResources)

Enum: "attachments" "supplier\_category" "supplier\_groups" "default\_payment\_term" "payment\_types" "default\_payment\_type" "payment\_currencies" "default\_payment\_currency" "supplier\_classification\_values"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_companies?include=payment_types,default_payment_type
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and full related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes`, `links`, and potentially `relationships`).

page

object (PageInput)

Customize pagination results with `size`.

## [](#tag/supplier_companies/operation/Create a Supplier Company)Create a Supplier Company

Create a supplier company with given attributes, relationships, and related complex resources.

When creating a supplier company with relationships, keep in mind that there are two kinds of relationships: linked resources and composite resources.

## Linked Resources

These are normal relationship resources managed outside of primary resource (supplier company). For example, payment currencies exist on their own, and can be assigned to one or many supplier companies, contracts, etc. These resources usually have their own API management endpoints.

All related objects should exist prior to being linked to the supplier company. They can be referenced by Workday Strategic Sourcing identifier, or by external ID; in the latter case, the relationship name is used with prefix `external_`. For example, a payment currency with Workday Strategic Sourcing ID `"1"` and external ID `"C$EUR"` can be used to initialize `default_payment_currency`:

```json
{
  "default_payment_currency": {
    "data" {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "payment_currencies"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "external_default_payment_currency": {
    "data" {
      "id": "C$EUR",
      "type": "payment_currencies"
    }
  }
}
```

When `external_` prefix is applied to a "many" relationship, like `external_payment_currencies`, all of the identifiers will be treated as external IDs.

## [](#tag/supplier_contacts/operation/List Supplier Contacts)List Supplier Contacts

Retrieves the list of contacts for an existing supplier company.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### path Parameters

company\_id

required

integer

Example: 1

Unique supplier company identifier.

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_contacts?include=supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierContactInputFilter)

Filter supplier contacts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

## [](#tag/supplier_contacts/operation/Create a Supplier Contact)Create a Supplier Contact

Create a supplier contact with given attributes.

## Linked Resources

The supplier company should exist prior to being linked to the supplier contact. It can be referenced by Workday Strategic Sourcing identifier, or by external ID; in the latter case, the relationship name is used with prefix `external_`. For example, a supplier company with Workday Strategic Sourcing ID `"1"` and external ID `"SCM-1"` can be used to initialize `supplier_company`:

```json
{
  "supplier_company": {
    "data" {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "supplier_companies"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "external_supplier_company": {
    "data" {
      "id": "SCM-1",
      "type": "supplier_companies"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

Use the `include` parameter to request a primary resource `supplier company`.

## [](#tag/supplier_contacts/operation/List Supplier Contacts by Supplier Company External ID)List Supplier Contacts by Supplier Company External ID

Retrieves the list of contacts for an existing supplier company by Supplier Company External ID.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### path Parameters

external\_id

required

string

Example: 1234-5678-abcd-efgh

Supplier company external identifier.

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_contacts?include=supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierContactInputFilter)

Filter supplier contacts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

## [](#tag/supplier_classifications/operation/List Supplier Classifications)List Supplier Classifications

Returns a list of supplier classifications.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierClassificationRelatedResources)

Value: "supplier\_classification\_fields"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_classifications?include=supplier_classification_fields
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierClassificationInputFilter)

Filter supplier classifications by codename.

## [](#tag/supplier_classifications/operation/Create a Supplier Classification)Create a Supplier Classification

Create a supplier classifications with given attributes, relationships, and related complex resources.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "supplier_classifications",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Classification 1",
      "order": 1,
      "country_alpha2": "CA",
      "codename": "diversity",
      "active": true,
      "external_id": "CLASSIFICATION-1",
      "request_additional_information": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Composite Resources

Resources that do not exist outside of parent resource, and are managed within the scope of parent resource, cannot be pre-created in advance. Supplier classifications have one composite resource `supplier_classification_fields` that includes another composite resource in itself - `supplier_classification_field_options`.

In order to create these resource along with the parent object, compound document must be used:

```json

  "data": {
    "type": "supplier_classifications",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Classification 1",
      "order": 1,

        }
      },
      {

## [](#tag/api_specification)API Specification

The API conforms to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org).

## [](#tag/date_and_time_fields)Date and Time Fields

Our API adheres to the ISO 8601 standard when accepting and formatting Date and Time fields. All Date and Time fields returned by this API will be in the **UTC** timezone.

Date and Time fields sent to this API can be in any timezone, provided they adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.

## [](#tag/authentication)Authentication

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every request will require all 3 HTTP headers:

HTTP Header

Description

**X-Api-Key**

a company-wide API key

**X-User-Token**

a user-specific API token

**X-User-Email**

user email

You can generate all of those from the _API tokens_ section of your _Profile_ page.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## [](#tag/rate_limiting)Rate Limiting

Rate limit windows are per second and are shared by all API Keys for a company.

The rate limit is 5 requests per second.

When request submissions exceed the limits, the limit-exceeding requests return `429 Too Many Requests` error responses to the client.

Upon receiving a `429` response, it is recommended to retry the request in compliance with the rate limit. One example would be to add a sleep function for 1 second and retry.

## [](#tag/external_ids)External Identifiers (IDs)

The `external_id` field exists on many of the Workday Strategic Sourcing resources. This optional and mutable extension is intended to store foreign keys of the corresponding resource from a third party system. **These IDs are not considered Sourcing Data and may be logged in external systems. Do not include any sensitive or personal data in IDs.**

The purpose of external IDs is to:

-   Prevent duplicate record creation
-   Allow resources in Workday Strategic Sourcing and a third party system to share the same identifier
-   Allow for records to be queried or updated without requiring knowledge of the Workday Strategic Sourcing generated IDs

## [](#tag/pagination)Pagination

Paginated endpoints may return a subset of the total results for a `GET` request that returns multiple resources. Endpoints that support pagination will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

The paginated results can be configured using the `page` query parameter to configure the number of returned results. The default pagination size is 10 results and the maximum pagination size is 100 results per request.

Endpoints that support pagination may return "self" and "next" sections within the "links" section that navigate to the current and next pages respectively.

### Example Paginated Request

#### Request Query Parameter Format

```
/projects?page[size]=25
```

#### Response Schema

The paginated response will also include the following schema

meta

object

Result set metadata.

links

object (PaginationLinks)

List of related links.

## [](#tag/filters)Filters

The results can be filtered to a subset of the total set of results using `filter` query parameters.

Endpoints that support filtering will include usage details in the Query Parameters section for the resource.

Most filters that end in `equals` support a Query Parameter array format to filter by multiple values.

Example:

```
?filter[status_equals][]=submitted&filter[status_equals][]=resubmitted
```

## [](#tag/supplier_companies/operation/List Supplier Companies)List Supplier Companies

Returns a list of supplier companies for the specified criteria.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

segmentation\_status

string (SupplierSegmentationStatus)

Deprecated

Enum: "not\_approved" "reviewing" "approved" "out\_of\_compliance" "blacklisted"

Filter suppliers by segmentation status.

filter

object (SupplierCompanyInputFilter)

Filter supplier companies by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

include

string (SupplierCompanyRelatedResources)

Enum: "attachments" "supplier\_category" "supplier\_groups" "default\_payment\_term" "payment\_types" "default\_payment\_type" "payment\_currencies" "default\_payment\_currency" "supplier\_classification\_values"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_companies?include=payment_types,default_payment_type
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and full related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes`, `links`, and potentially `relationships`).

page

object (PageInput)

Customize pagination results with `size`.

## [](#tag/supplier_companies/operation/Create a Supplier Company)Create a Supplier Company

Create a supplier company with given attributes, relationships, and related complex resources.

When creating a supplier company with relationships, keep in mind that there are two kinds of relationships: linked resources and composite resources.

## Linked Resources

These are normal relationship resources managed outside of primary resource (supplier company). For example, payment currencies exist on their own, and can be assigned to one or many supplier companies, contracts, etc. These resources usually have their own API management endpoints.

All related objects should exist prior to being linked to the supplier company. They can be referenced by Workday Strategic Sourcing identifier, or by external ID; in the latter case, the relationship name is used with prefix `external_`. For example, a payment currency with Workday Strategic Sourcing ID `"1"` and external ID `"C$EUR"` can be used to initialize `default_payment_currency`:

```json
{
  "default_payment_currency": {
    "data" {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "payment_currencies"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "external_default_payment_currency": {
    "data" {
      "id": "C$EUR",
      "type": "payment_currencies"
    }
  }
}
```

When `external_` prefix is applied to a "many" relationship, like `external_payment_currencies`, all of the identifiers will be treated as external IDs.

## [](#tag/supplier_contacts/operation/List Supplier Contacts)List Supplier Contacts

Retrieves the list of contacts for an existing supplier company.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### path Parameters

company\_id

required

integer

Example: 1

Unique supplier company identifier.

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_contacts?include=supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierContactInputFilter)

Filter supplier contacts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

## [](#tag/supplier_contacts/operation/Create a Supplier Contact)Create a Supplier Contact

Create a supplier contact with given attributes.

## Linked Resources

The supplier company should exist prior to being linked to the supplier contact. It can be referenced by Workday Strategic Sourcing identifier, or by external ID; in the latter case, the relationship name is used with prefix `external_`. For example, a supplier company with Workday Strategic Sourcing ID `"1"` and external ID `"SCM-1"` can be used to initialize `supplier_company`:

```json
{
  "supplier_company": {
    "data" {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "supplier_companies"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "external_supplier_company": {
    "data" {
      "id": "SCM-1",
      "type": "supplier_companies"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

Use the `include` parameter to request a primary resource `supplier company`.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### path Parameters

external\_id

required

string

Example: 1234-5678-abcd-efgh

Supplier company external identifier.

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierContactRelatedResources)

Enum: "supplier\_company" "contact\_types" "phones"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_contacts?include=supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierContactInputFilter)

Filter supplier contacts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

## [](#tag/supplier_classifications/operation/List Supplier Classifications)List Supplier Classifications

Returns a list of supplier classifications.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

include

string (SupplierClassificationRelatedResources)

Value: "supplier\_classification\_fields"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/supplier_classifications?include=supplier_classification_fields
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes` that have a corresponding `external_id`).

filter

object (SupplierClassificationInputFilter)

Filter supplier classifications by codename.

## [](#tag/supplier_classifications/operation/Create a Supplier Classification)Create a Supplier Classification

Create a supplier classifications with given attributes, relationships, and related complex resources.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "supplier_classifications",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Classification 1",
      "order": 1,
      "country_alpha2": "CA",
      "codename": "diversity",
      "active": true,
      "external_id": "CLASSIFICATION-1",
      "request_additional_information": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Composite Resources

Resources that do not exist outside of parent resource, and are managed within the scope of parent resource, cannot be pre-created in advance. Supplier classifications have one composite resource `supplier_classification_fields` that includes another composite resource in itself - `supplier_classification_field_options`.

In order to create these resource along with the parent object, compound document must be used:

```json

  "data": {
    "type": "supplier_classifications",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Classification 1",
      "order": 1,

        ]
      }
    },

        "type": "supplier_classification_fields",

          "order": 1,
          "external_id": "CLASSIFICATION-FIELD-OPTION-1"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "CLASSIFICATION-FIELD-OPTION-2",
        "type": "supplier_classification_field_options",
        "attributes": {

## [](#tag/contracts/operation/List Contracts)List Contracts

Returns a list of contracts for the specified criteria.

##### Authorizations:

(_api\_key__user\_token__user\_email_)

##### query Parameters

filter

object (ContractInputFilter)

Filter contracts by multiple criteria. Only one filter per attribute is supported. For best performance, we recommend 5 or less filters.

include

string (ContractRelatedResources)

Enum: "attachments" "contract\_type" "supplier\_company" "docusign\_envelopes" "adobe\_sign\_agreements"

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, related resources can be requested along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents". In a compound document, all included resources will be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level `included` member.

The value of the `include` parameter must be a comma-separated list of relationships from the list of available relationships.

```
/contracts?include=contract_type,supplier_company
```

In the response, relationships will be represented as normal linkage objects (containing `id` and `type`), and full related resource details will be presented in the `included` section as resource objects (with `attributes`, `links`, and potentially `relationships`).

page

object (PageInput)

Customize pagination results with `size`.

## [](#tag/events/operation/Create an Event)Create an Event

Events can only be created from a template. When a creation request is issued, the base event object will be created from the template and returned with the response. Child records such as attachments, price sheets, custom values, will be scheduled for copy asynchronously. Current duplication status can be retrieved from the `duplication_state` attribute, which will have one of following values:

-   `scheduled` - duplication is scheduled, but not yet started;
-   `started` - duplication started, but not yet finished;
-   `finished` - duplication completed;
-   `failed` - there was an error duplicating relationships.

An event should always have an associated project, please make sure to specify it as always relationship object.

Please note, this endpoint does not support auction creation/duplication.

## [](#tag/attachments)Attachments

Use the attachments API to create, update, and delete the attachments in Workday Strategic Sourcing.

## [](#tag/attachments/Working-with-Attachments)Working with Attachments

Creating attachments for Workday Strategic Sourcing objects is a two-step process. First, you need to inform the system about your intention to upload an attachment by issuing a "Create an Attachment" request, consisting of the file name and a link to the object to which you are adding an attachment. The link is represented by a relationship object containing an object ID and its type.

In the response you will receive a link in the `upload_url` attributes, along with required HTTP headers to send with your file. You will need to upload your file as a binary stream in a PUT request into the specified URL, making sure the required headers are present. Here is how the workflow might look like when triggered from a console:

```bash
$ curl -H "X-Api-Key: ${COMPANY_KEY}" \
       -H "X-User-Token: ${USER_TOKEN}" \
       -H "X-User-Email: ${USER_EMAIL}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
       -X POST \
       -d '
         {
           "data": {
             "type": "attachments",
             "attributes": {
               "title": "My Interesting Document",
               "file_name": "Some Interesting File.pdf"
             },
             "relationships": {
               "contract": {
                 "data": {
                   "id": 1,
                   "type": "contracts"
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       ' \
       "https://api.scoutrfp.com/v3/attachments"

{
    "data": {
        "id": "1",
        "type": "attachments",
        "attributes": {

            "file_size": null,
            "upload_url": "https://upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/contract/1/hex/file.pdf?some=very&long=url",
            "upload_headers": [
                {
                    "name": "Content-Type",
                    "value": "application/octet-stream"
                },
                {
                    "name": "x-amz-acl",
                    "value": "private"
                },
                {
                    "name": "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
                    "value": "AES256"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Content-Disposition",
                    "value": "attachment"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

$ curl -X PUT \
    --data "@file.pdf" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    -H "x-amz-acl: private" \
    -H "x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256" \
    -H "Content-Disposition: attachment" \
    https://upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/contract/1/hex/file.pdf?some=very&long=url
```

The upload URL expires within 15 minutes after issuing. Please note that you will not be able to upload the data file to the attachment object after that. An automated system will purge all partial uploads after a certain period (usually within 30-60 minutes after creation) to prevent orphan records from overflowing the system.

**Please Note**: The list of headers and their values might change at any time, so when you're implementing an integration with the Workday Strategic Sourcing system, make sure to include all of the HTTP headers returned from the attachments endpoint.

## [](#tag/attachments/operation/Create an Attachment)Create an Attachment

Create an attachment for an object. This endpoint represents the first step in the two-step upload workflow, described in the [Working with Attachments](#section/Working-with-Attachments) section.

The only required attribute is `file_name`, which will be used to generate attachment title (if a custom one is not supplied), and the upload URL. You will also need to specify the object to which you want to add an attachment (see `relationships` property).
