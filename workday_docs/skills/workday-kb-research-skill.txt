MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE
================================================================================

Research "{TOPIC}" on this Workday Community site.

RULES (CRITICAL - NO HALLUCINATIONS):
1. ONLY extract info visible on THIS page/site
2. Say "NOT FOUND" if topic has no clear documentation
3. NEVER guess or invent steps, fields, or processes
4. ALWAYS cite the exact source URL
5. Note any PDFs available for download (I'll download manually)

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Use the search box at top of page
2. Click most relevant KB article or documentation
3. Read full page content before extracting
4. Check related articles if needed

EXTRACT:
- Business process steps (numbered 1, 2, 3...)
- Required fields with data types
- Validation rules
- UI navigation path

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "topic": "{TOPIC}",
  "source_url": "exact page URL",
  "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NOT_FOUND",
  "steps": [
    "1. Navigate to...",
    "2. Click...",
    "3. Enter..."
  ],
  "fields": [
    {"name": "Worker", "type": "lookup", "required": true}
  ],
  "validation": ["Rule 1...", "Rule 2..."],
  "navigation": "Search > Task Name > ...",
  "downloads": ["filename.pdf if available"],
  "notes": "Any additional context"
}

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- HIGH: Direct KB article with step-by-step instructions
- MEDIUM: Related article, some inference needed
- LOW: Only tangential information found
- NOT_FOUND: No documentation exists for this topic

IF NOT FOUND:
{
  "topic": "{TOPIC}",
  "confidence": "NOT_FOUND",
  "suggestion": "Try alternative search: [terms]"
}
