## Overview

**Job History Industries** is reference data in Workday that provides a list of industry classifications for use when recording a worker's previous employment history. When workers or HR administrators add prior work experience (job history from previous employers), they can select from the configured list of industries to categorize the previous employer's business sector.

## Purpose

- Standardize industry classification across worker job history records
- Enable reporting and analytics on workers' prior industry experience
- Support talent acquisition by filtering candidates with specific industry backgrounds
- Facilitate compliance with industry-specific regulations (e.g., financial services, healthcare)

## Common Industry Categories

## Integration Considerations

### SOAP API:
- No direct WSDL operation for Job History Industries specifically
- Related: Put_Previous_System_Job_History (Human_Resources.wsdl)
- Related: Get_Previous_System_Job_History (Human_Resources.wsdl)

### REST API:
- Reference Data APIs may provide access if configured
- Typically managed through UI for small reference datasets

## Common Issues

1. **Industry Not Appearing in Dropdown**:
   - Check if Active = Yes
   - Verify security access to reference data

2. **Duplicate Industries**:
   - Review Reference IDs for uniqueness
   - Consolidate duplicates via edit/inactivate

3. **Migration Validation**:
   - Compare count of industries with source system
   - Verify all migrated industries are present

## Best Practices

1. Use consistent naming conventions
2. Include Reference IDs for integration purposes
3. Keep industry list manageable (not overly granular)
4. Regularly review and inactivate obsolete industries
5. Document custom industries specific to organization
6. Consider NAICS or SIC alignment for standard reporting
