- ROU Asset and Lease Liability for other operating leases
- Straight-line lease expense over term

- May have different classifications between standards
- Separate book codes for each standard

================================================================================
FINANCE LEASE CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Finance leases differ from operating leases in accounting treatment:

CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA (ASC 842):
A lease is classified as Finance if ANY of these criteria are met:
1. Transfer of ownership at end of lease
2. Purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised
3. Lease term is major part of asset's economic life (typically >= 75%)
4. Present value of payments is substantially all of asset's fair value (>= 90%)
5. Specialized asset with no alternative use

FINANCE LEASE ACCOUNTING:
- ROU Asset: Recorded at present value of lease payments + initial direct costs
- Lease Liability: Present value of remaining lease payments
- Amortization: ROU Asset depreciated over shorter of lease term or useful life
- Interest Expense: Calculated on lease liability balance (front-loaded)
- Expense Pattern: Total expense is front-loaded (higher in early periods)
