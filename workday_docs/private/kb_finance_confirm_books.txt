================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The "Confirm Books" process is part of Workday's period-end close procedure
that allows finance teams to verify and confirm the status of accounting books
(Book Codes) for specific ledger periods. This is critical for multi-GAAP
reporting environments where organizations maintain separate books for
different accounting standards (US GAAP, IFRS, Tax, Statutory).

Business Context:
- Confirms that all transactions for a book code are complete
- Marks a book as ready for financial reporting
- Part of the close checklist before period lock
- Enables segregation of close activities by book type

Book Codes (Examples):
- Primary/GAAP: US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
- IFRS: International Financial Reporting Standards
- Tax: Tax basis accounting
- Statutory: Local statutory requirements
- Management: Internal management reporting

================================================================================
KEY COMPONENTS
================================================================================

1. LEDGER PERIOD STATUS
   - Open: Transactions can be posted
   - Closed: No new transactions allowed
   - Confirmed: Book validated and ready for reporting

2. BOOK CODE
   - Identifies the accounting standard/purpose
   - Each company can have multiple book codes
   - Journals are tagged with book codes

3. COMPANY/COMPANY HIERARCHY
   - Confirm books at company or hierarchy level
   - Roll-up confirmation for consolidated reporting

4. FISCAL YEAR/POSTING INTERVAL
   - Specify which fiscal period to confirm
   - Monthly, quarterly, or annual intervals
