OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Book Codes in Workday Financial Management are identifiers that allow
organizations to maintain multiple sets of accounting records (books) under
different accounting standards or reporting requirements. This enables
multi-GAAP reporting for organizations that need to comply with multiple
accounting frameworks simultaneously.

Business Purpose:
- Multi-GAAP Compliance: Maintain US GAAP, IFRS, Tax, and Statutory books
- Regulatory Reporting: Meet different reporting requirements
- Management Analysis: Create internal management views
- Consolidation: Enable proper consolidation across frameworks
- Audit Trail: Maintain separate audit trails per framework

Key Concept:
Each journal entry can be tagged with a book code, allowing the same
transaction to be recorded differently across multiple books while
maintaining a single system of record.

================================================================================
STANDARD BOOK CODE TYPES
================================================================================

| Book Code | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Primary | US GAAP or primary reporting | SEC filings, external financial statements |
| IFRS | International Financial Reporting Standards | Global subsidiaries, EU reporting |
| Tax | Tax basis accounting | Tax returns, tax provisions |
| Statutory | Local statutory requirements | Country-specific compliance |
| Management | Internal management reporting | Internal analysis, budgeting |
| GAAP-Adj | GAAP Adjustments | US GAAP-specific adjustments |
| Custom | Organization-specific codes | Special purpose reporting |

BOOK CODE USE IN TRANSACTIONS
================================================================================

1. JOURNAL ENTRIES
-----------------
When creating journals, users can specify:

- Book-Specific Entries: Adjustments only for specific books

Example Scenarios:
- Primary journal posts to all books
- IFRS adjustment posts only to IFRS book

2. PERIOD CLOSE
---------------
Book codes enable independent close for each standard:
- Primary may close on day 5

- Tax may close on day 15 (after tax calculations)

Status Tracking Per Book:
- Open: Transactions allowed

3. FINANCIAL REPORTING
----------------------
Reports can be filtered by book code:
- Trial Balance by Book Code
- Financial Statements by Book Code

MULTI-GAAP REPORTING WORKFLOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: Record Primary Transactions
- All operational transactions post to Primary book
- Automatic postings from sub-ledgers (AP, AR, FA)
- Primary book is baseline for all reporting

STEP 2: Record IFRS Adjustments
- Create book-specific journals for IFRS differences
- Common adjustments: Lease accounting, revenue recognition
- Post to IFRS book code only

STEP 3: Record Tax Adjustments
- Create book-specific journals for book-to-tax differences
- Common adjustments: Depreciation, provisions, timing differences
- Post to Tax book code only

STEP 4: Record Statutory Adjustments
- Create book-specific journals for local GAAP differences
- Country-specific accounting requirements
- Post to Statutory book code only

STEP 5: Close Books in Sequence
- Confirm Primary book first
- Confirm IFRS book (after IFRS adjustments complete)
- Confirm Tax book (after tax provisions calculated)
- Confirm Statutory book (after local adjustments)

STEP 6: Generate Reports
- Run financial statements per book code
- Create reconciliation reports between books
- Document book-to-book differences

================================================================================
BOOK CODE RECONCILIATION
================================================================================

Report: "Trial Balance Comparison by Book Code"

Compares balances across book codes:
- Shows Primary vs IFRS differences
- Shows Primary vs Tax differences
- Identifies accounts with book-specific entries

Common Reconciliation Items:
- Lease assets/liabilities (IFRS 16 vs ASC 842)
- Revenue timing differences
- Depreciation method variances
- Tax provision differences
- Currency translation adjustments

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

1. Establish clear book code naming conventions
2. Document purpose of each book code
3. Define which adjustments go to which book
4. Set up book-specific security access
5. Create clear close calendar per book
6. Automate reconciliation reports
7. Train users on book code selection
8. Review book code usage quarterly
9. Archive book-specific documentation
10. Audit inter-book reconciliations

================================================================================
