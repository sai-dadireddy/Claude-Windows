OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The "Audit Missing Payment Elections" report identifies workers who are active
in a company but do not have the required payment elections configured. Payment
elections determine how workers receive their pay (direct deposit, check, etc.)
and are required before payroll can be processed successfully.

This audit is critical before running payroll to ensure all workers will receive
their payments through proper channels. The report shows MISSING elections only,
not a list of existing elections.
