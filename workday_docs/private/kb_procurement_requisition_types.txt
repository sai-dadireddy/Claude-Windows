OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Requisition Types are reference data that classify procurement requests and
drive business process routing, sourcing rules, and reporting dimensions.
They help distinguish between different types of purchases and enable
differentiated approval workflows and sourcing strategies.

Functional Area: Procurement / Resource Management
Task: Maintain Requisition Types / View Requisition Types
Typical Users: Procurement Configurator, Procurement Administrator
Configuration Level: Tenant-wide reference data

================================================================================
KEY COMPONENTS
================================================================================

1. STANDARD REQUISITION TYPES
   - Goods: Physical items, equipment, supplies
   - Services: Professional services, consulting, maintenance
   - Contingent Worker: Temporary staff, contractors
   - Catalog: Items from approved supplier catalogs
   - Non-Catalog: Custom or one-time purchases

2. REQUISITION TYPE ATTRIBUTES
   - Requisition Type ID (unique identifier)
   - Requisition Type Name (display name)
   - Description (purpose and usage notes)
   - Inactive Flag (for retiring types)
   - Associated Business Process Rules

3. SOURCING RULE INTEGRATION
   - Requisition types can trigger different sourcing rules
   - Automatic supplier selection based on type
   - Preferred supplier routing
   - Competitive bidding requirements

4. BUSINESS PROCESS LOGIC
   - Approval routing based on requisition type
   - Different approval thresholds per type
   - Procurement review requirements
   - Finance oversight levels

================================================================================
NAVIGATION STEPS
================================================================================

TASK: VIEW/MAINTAIN REQUISITION TYPES
--------------------------------------
1. Search: "Maintain Requisition Types" or "View Requisition Types"
2. Click search result to open configuration task
3. Review existing requisition types in list view
4. Click specific type to view details
5. Use "Edit" to modify existing type
6. Use "Create Requisition Type" for new types

TASK: CREATE REQUISITION TYPE
-----------------------------
1. Search: "Create Requisition Type"
2. Click search result to open creation form
3. Enter Requisition Type ID (unique code)
4. Enter Requisition Type Name
5. Add Description (optional but recommended)
6. Configure sourcing and routing options
7. Submit for activation

TASK: REVIEW FOR SOURCING RULES
-------------------------------
1. Search: "View Requisition Types" or "Maintain Requisition Types"
2. Export list for documentation
3. Review each type's description
4. Identify types used for sourcing rule conditions
5. Document current type usage and business purpose
6. Identify needed adjustments or new types

================================================================================
FIELD REFERENCE
================================================================================

| Field Name           | Type      | Required | Description                      |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Requisition Type ID | Text      | Yes      | Unique identifier code           |
| Requisition Type    | Text      | Yes      | Display name                     |
| Description         | Text      | No       | Purpose and usage notes          |
| Inactive            | Checkbox  | No       | Marks type as inactive           |

================================================================================
SOURCING RULES INTEGRATION
================================================================================

Requisition Types serve as a key dimension in sourcing rules:

1. SOURCING RULE CONDITIONS
   - "If Requisition Type = 'Services' THEN route to Procurement Review"
   - "If Requisition Type = 'Contingent Worker' THEN require staffing approval"
   - "If Requisition Type = 'Catalog' AND Amount > $5000 THEN require manager approval"

2. SUPPLIER ROUTING
   - Preferred suppliers by requisition type
   - Automatic supplier selection for catalog types
   - RFQ requirements for non-catalog types

3. APPROVAL LOGIC
   - Different approval chains based on type
   - Services may require additional SOW review
   - Contingent workers may require HR involvement

================================================================================
BUSINESS PROCESS LOGIC EXAMPLES
================================================================================

Sample BP Logic Using Requisition Type:

```
Condition: Requisition Type
  - If Goods → Standard approval chain
  - If Services → Add Contract Review step
  - If Contingent Worker → Add HR Approval step
  - If Non-Catalog → Add Procurement Review step
  - If Catalog → Skip competitive review (pre-negotiated pricing)
```

Threshold Variations:
- Goods: Manager $5K, Director $25K, VP $100K
- Services: Manager $2.5K, Director $10K, VP $50K
- Contingent: Any amount requires HR approval

================================================================================
AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

UI Selectors:
- Search Box: input[data-automation-id="searchBox"]
- Requisition Type List: table[data-automation-id="requisitionTypeTable"]
- Create Button: button:contains("Create Requisition Type")
- Edit Button: button:contains("Edit")
- View Details: link[data-automation-id="requisitionTypeLink"]
- Inactive Checkbox: checkbox[data-automation-id="inactive"]

Validation:
- Requisition Type ID must be unique
- Name should be descriptive and distinct
- Description should explain business purpose
- Review sourcing rules before modifying types
- Check business process conditions using type

Error Handling:
- "Duplicate ID" - Use different Requisition Type ID
- "Cannot delete in use" - Mark inactive instead
- "Sourcing rule dependency" - Update sourcing rules first

Screenshot Strategy:
1. List of all requisition types
2. Individual requisition type details
3. Sourcing rules using type (if accessible)
4. Business process conditions using type

================================================================================

================================================================================
RELATED CONFIGURATIONS
================================================================================

- Sourcing Rules: Use requisition type as condition dimension
- Business Process Conditions: Route approvals by requisition type
- Spend Categories: Map to requisition types for reporting
- Approval Routing: Different chains per requisition type
- Procurement Settings: Type-specific policies

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

1. Keep requisition types limited and well-defined
2. Use clear, business-meaningful names
3. Document purpose in description field
4. Review sourcing rules when modifying types
5. Test business process routing after changes
6. Communicate changes to requestors
7. Train users on when to use each type
8. Audit type usage quarterly
9. Consolidate similar types to reduce complexity
10. Maintain alignment with procurement policies

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Requisition types are tenant-level configuration
- Changes affect all future requisitions
- Existing requisitions retain their assigned type
- Cannot delete types used by existing requisitions
- Types drive both sourcing and approval logic
- Custom types can be created for specific needs
- Type selection impacts downstream PO creation
- Review spend analytics by requisition type regularly
