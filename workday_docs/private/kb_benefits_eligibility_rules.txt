OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Benefit Eligibility Rules in Workday determine which employees qualify for
specific benefit plans. These rules evaluate employee attributes (employment
status, hours worked, job classification, location, etc.) to automatically
assign or restrict access to benefit plans.

Key Concepts:
- Eligibility Rules: Criteria that must be met to enroll in a plan
- Benefit Groups: Collections of plans with shared eligibility
- Eligibility Events: Triggers that evaluate eligibility (hire, job change)
- Waiting Periods: Time between eligibility and enrollment availability
- Coverage Targets: Who can be covered (employee, dependents)

Rule Types:
- Employee Type Rules (Full-time, Part-time, Temporary)
- Hours-Based Rules (minimum hours per week/month)
- Job Classification Rules (exempt, non-exempt, union)
- Location Rules (state, country, work location)
- Tenure Rules (years of service)
- Custom Rules (calculated fields, conditions)

   - Document complex rule logic

3. WAITING PERIODS
   - Align with company policy and regulations
   - Consider ACA 90-day maximum for full-time employees
   - Coordinate with payroll for deduction timing

4. BENEFIT GROUPS
   - Create logical groupings (by country, employee type)
   - Set clear priority order
   - Review group assignments regularly

5. ELIGIBILITY EVENTS
   - Define all triggering events
   - Set reasonable enrollment windows
   - Require documentation for life events
   - Test event processing end-to-end

6. DEPENDENT ELIGIBILITY
   - Define age limits clearly (e.g., children to 26)

TROUBLESHOOTING ELIGIBILITY ISSUES
================================================================================

1. EMPLOYEE NOT SHOWING AS ELIGIBLE
   Check:
   - Employee Type matches rule criteria
   - Hours meet minimum requirement
   - Waiting period has passed
   - No eligibility rule exclusions
   - Benefit group assignment correct

2. WRONG BENEFIT GROUP ASSIGNED
   Check:
   - Group eligibility rules
   - Group priority order
   - Employee attributes match correct group
   - Effective dates of group assignments

3. WAITING PERIOD CALCULATED INCORRECTLY
   Check:
   - Hire date accuracy
   - Waiting period type configuration
   - Eligibility date calculation rule
   - Calendar vs. business days setting

4. ENROLLMENT EVENT NOT GENERATED
   Check:
   - Enrollment event type configuration
   - Triggering business process completed
   - Employee meets eligibility criteria
   - Enrollment window hasn't expired

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Eligibility rules are evaluated when business processes complete
- Changes to rules affect future eligibility; retro changes require reprocessing
- Benefit groups simplify management of multiple plans
- Waiting periods cannot exceed 90 days for ACA-covered plans
- Enrollment events have configurable windows (typically 31 days)
- Coverage targets define dependent eligibility by plan
- Custom rules allow complex eligibility logic via calculated fields
- Audit reports should be run periodically for compliance
- Rule changes should be tested in sandbox before production
