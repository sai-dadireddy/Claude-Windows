## Overview

**Extract tasks** in Workday are standardized data export utilities that allow users to extract configuration data, master data, and transactional data for auditing, reporting, and integration purposes. Most extract tasks follow a consistent workflow pattern.

## Common Extract Task Types

### Organizational Data Extracts:
- Extract Companies
- Extract Locations
- Extract Cost Centers
- Extract Regions
- Extract Supervisory Organizations

### Worker Data Extracts:
- Extract Worker Names
- Extract Worker Organization Assignments
- Extract Worker Job Details
- Extract Worker Service Dates
- Extract Worker Contact Information
- Extract Worker IDs
- Extract Worker Personal Information
- Extract Employee Core Compensation Details

### Configuration Data Extracts:
- Extract Job Profiles
- Extract Compensation Grades and Grade Profiles
- Extract Compensation Plans
- Extract Security Group Assignments
- Extract Organization Role Assignments
- Extract Worker Union Memberships

## Standard Extract Task Workflow

### Navigation:
1. Search for specific extract task (e.g., "Extract Companies")
2. Select task from search results
3. Task interface opens with parameters

### Common Parameters:

Most extract tasks include some or all of these parameters:

**Filtering Parameters:**
- **Organization**: Limit to specific organization(s)
- **Worker**: Limit to specific worker(s)
- **Effective Date**: Data as of which date
- **Include Inactive**: Yes/No checkbox

**Output Format Parameters:**
- **File Format**: Usually CSV (default) or Excel
- **Include Headers**: Yes (recommended)
- **Delimiter**: Comma, Tab, Pipe

**Scope Parameters:**
- **Include Supervisory Organizations**: Yes/No
- **Include Subordinate Organizations**: Yes/No
- **Include Related Data**: Depends on extract type

### Execution:
1. Configure parameters (or use defaults)
2. Click "OK" or "Submit"
3. System displays confirmation message
4. Extract runs in background

### Retrieval:
1. Wait for processing (30 seconds to several minutes)
2. Navigate to Workday Inbox
3. Find extract completion notification
4. Click notification to view details
5. Click download link or file name
6. File downloads to local machine
7. Open in Excel or CSV viewer for review

## Automation Considerations for Electron

### Generic Extract Task Pattern:

```
# Step 1: Navigate to Extract Task
enter search box as "{Extract Task Name}"
wait for search results
click search result containing "{Extract Task Name}"
wait for page to load

# Step 2: Configure Parameters (optional - most have good defaults)
select Include Inactive as "No"
enter Effective Date as "{current_date}"

# Step 3: Submit Extract
click button "OK" or "Submit"
wait for confirmation
verify message contains "submitted" or "processing"
screenshot as "{test_id}_extract_submitted.png"

# Step 4: Retrieve Results from Inbox
wait 30 seconds
enter search box as "Inbox"
click search result "Inbox"
wait for page to load
scroll to find "{Extract Task Name}"
click notification containing "{Extract Task Name}"
wait for page to load

# Step 5: Download File
click link "Download" or file name
verify file downloaded

```

### Extract-Specific Variations:

**Worker-Specific Extracts:**
If extract requires worker selection:
```
enter Worker field as "{worker_name}"
wait for worker search results
click worker result containing "{worker_name}"
```

**Organization-Specific Extracts:**
If extract requires organization selection:
```
enter Organization field as "{org_name}"
wait for organization search results
click organization result containing "{org_name}"
```

**Date Range Extracts:**
If extract supports date ranges:
```
enter From Date as "{start_date}"
enter To Date as "{end_date}"
```

## UI Selectors for Extract Tasks

**Common Field Names:**
- Include Inactive: "Include Inactive", "Include Terminated"
- Effective Date: "Effective Date", "As of Date", "Date"
- Organization: "Organization", "Supervisory Organization"
- Worker: "Worker", "Employee"
- Submit Button: "OK", "Submit", "Run"

**Inbox Selectors:**
- Inbox Link: "Inbox", "My Inbox"
- Notification: Extract task name in notification title
- Download Link: "Download", file name (usually ends in .csv or .xlsx)

## Validation Steps

**Post-Submission:**
- Confirmation message displayed
- Message contains "submitted" or "processing" or similar success indicator

**Post-Download:**
- File downloaded successfully to downloads folder
- File format is CSV or Excel
- File is not empty
- File contains header row
- Data rows present (if data exists)

## Error Handling

**Common Errors:**

1. **"No data found"**:
   - Cause: No data matches parameters, or data doesn't exist
   - Resolution: Adjust parameters, verify data exists in tenant

2. **"Insufficient permissions"**:
   - Cause: User lacks View access to data domain
   - Resolution: Request security access from administrator

3. **"Invalid organization"**:
   - Cause: Organization name not recognized or misspelled
   - Resolution: Use organization picker instead of typing

4. **"Processing timeout"**:
   - Cause: Extract too large, system busy
   - Resolution: Narrow parameters, try during off-peak hours

5. **"File not available"**:
   - Cause: Processing not complete yet
   - Resolution: Wait longer, check inbox again after 2-5 minutes

## Extract Task Categories

### Setup/Configuration Audits:
Purpose: Verify configuration data accuracy
Examples: Extract Job Profiles, Extract Compensation Plans
Typical Users: HR Administrators, System Administrators

### Worker Data Audits:
Purpose: Verify worker data accuracy, support data conversion validation
Examples: Extract Worker Names, Extract Worker Organization Assignments
Typical Users: HR Auditors, Data Migration Teams

### Compliance/Security Audits:
Purpose: Support compliance reviews, security audits
Examples: Extract Security Group Assignments, Extract Organization Role Assignments
Typical Users: Security Administrators, Audit Teams

### Integration Support:
Purpose: Provide data for external systems
Examples: Various worker and organizational extracts
Typical Users: Integration Developers, Third-Party System Administrators

## Best Practices

1. **Default Parameters**: Most extracts work well with default parameters
2. **Effective Dating**: Always specify effective date for point-in-time snapshots
3. **File Naming**: Note the auto-generated file name for tracking
4. **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular extracts for ongoing data quality monitoring
5. **Documentation**: Document parameters used and audit findings
6. **Performance**: Run large extracts during off-peak hours
7. **Storage**: Save extract files with clear naming conventions for future reference

## Security Considerations

**Domain Permissions Required:**
- Most extracts require **View** access to relevant domain
- Examples:
  - Worker extracts: Worker Data domains (Contact Info, Organization Assignments, etc.)
  - Organization extracts: Organization Setup domains
  - Security extracts: Security Administration domains

**Typical Security Groups:**
- HR Auditor
- HR Administrator
- Integration Administrator
- Security Administrator
- System Administrator

## Integration with Other Processes

**Data Conversion Validation:**
- Used extensively during implementation to validate converted data
- Compare extract results with source system data
- Identify discrepancies for correction

**Ongoing Audits:**
- Quarterly or annual compliance reviews
- Pre/post major configuration changes
- Support for external audits (SOX, etc.)

**Reporting:**
- Supplement standard Workday reports
- Provide data for custom analytics
- Export for executive dashboards

## Alternative Approaches

**Instead of Extract Tasks, consider:**

1. **Custom Reports**: For regularly-needed data with specific format
2. **Report Writer**: For complex data queries
3. **Integration Services**: For scheduled, automated exports
4. **EIB (Enterprise Interface Builder)**: For regular file-based integration
5. **REST/SOAP APIs**: For real-time data access
