4. AUTHENTICATION METHOD
================================================================================

The Workday Strategic Sourcing API uses API KEY authentication.
Every request requires ALL 3 HTTP headers:

| HTTP Header    | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| X-Api-Key      | Company-wide API key           |
| X-User-Token   | User-specific API token        |
| X-User-Email   | User email address             |

These credentials can be generated from the "API tokens" section of the user's Profile page.

Security Requirements:
- All API requests MUST be made over HTTPS
- HTTP calls will fail
- Unauthenticated requests will fail
- Keep API keys secure - do not share in public repositories or client-side code
