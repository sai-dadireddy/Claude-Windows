OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Supplier Contract Types are reference data that classify supplier contracts
into categories for reporting, workflow routing, and feature configuration.
They define how contracts are processed, what features are enabled, and
which business processes apply.

Functional Area: Procurement / Resource Management
Task: Maintain Supplier Contract Types / Create Supplier Contract Type
Typical Users: Accounts Payable Configurator, Procurement Administrator
Configuration Level: Tenant-wide reference data

================================================================================
KEY COMPONENTS
================================================================================

1. SUPPLIER CONTRACT TYPE ATTRIBUTES
   - Contract Type ID (unique identifier)
   - Contract Type Name (display name)
   - Description (purpose/usage notes)
   - Inactive Flag (for retiring contract types)
   - Default Settings (payment terms, tax handling)

2. FEATURE CONFIGURATIONS
   - Catalog Integration (enable/disable catalog discounts)
   - Invoice Matching (PO-based vs contract-based)
   - Amendment Workflow (approval requirements)
   - Auto-renewal Settings
   - Hold Settings (enable contract line holds)
   - Purchase Order Integration

3. WORKFLOW ROUTING
   - Approval Chain based on contract type
   - Contract Specialist assignment
   - Buyer assignment rules
   - Notification recipients

4. REPORTING CLASSIFICATION
   - Spend analysis categorization
   - Contract portfolio groupings
   - Compliance reporting filters

================================================================================

5. Use "Edit" to modify existing type
6. Use "Create Supplier Contract Type" for new types

TASK: CREATE SUPPLIER CONTRACT TYPE
-----------------------------------
1. Search: "Create Supplier Contract Type"
2. Click search result to open creation form
3. Enter Contract Type ID (unique code)
4. Enter Contract Type Name
5. Add Description (optional but recommended)
6. Configure feature settings:
   - Enable/Disable catalog integration
   - Set default payment terms
   - Configure amendment settings
7. Submit for approval (if business process configured)

TASK: REVIEW AND AUDIT CONTRACT TYPES
-------------------------------------
1. Search: "View Supplier Contract Types" or "Maintain Supplier Contract Types"
2. Export list if needed for audit
3. Review each type's feature configuration
4. Identify unused or duplicate types
5. Document adjustments needed
6. Create change requests for modifications

FIELD REFERENCE
================================================================================

| Field Name               | Type      | Required | Description                    |
|-------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| Contract Type ID        | Text      | Yes      | Unique identifier              |
| Contract Type Name      | Text      | Yes      | Display name                   |
| Description             | Text      | No       | Purpose and usage notes        |
| Inactive                | Checkbox  | No       | Marks type as inactive         |
| Catalog Discount        | Checkbox  | No       | Enable catalog discount %      |

================================================================================
WORKDAY SOAP API OPERATIONS
================================================================================

Relevant WSDL: Resource_Management

Key Operations:

1. Submit_Supplier_Contract (includes Supplier_Contract_Type reference)
   - Supplier Contract Type is a reference field
   - Used to classify contracts during creation
   - Required for proper workflow routing

2. Get_Supplier_Contracts
   - Returns Supplier Contract Type in response
   - Filterable by contract type for reporting

Note: There is no direct API operation for managing Supplier Contract Types.
Contract Types are reference data managed through Workday configuration UI.
For programmatic access, use Raas (Report-as-a-Service) or EIB.

================================================================================
AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

UI Selectors:
- Search Box: input[data-automation-id="searchBox"]
- Contract Type List: table[data-automation-id="contractTypeTable"]
- Create Button: button:contains("Create Supplier Contract Type")
- Edit Button: button:contains("Edit")
- View Details: link[data-automation-id="contractTypeLink"]

Validation:
- Contract Type ID must be unique
- Name should be descriptive and not duplicate existing
- Review feature settings against business requirements
- Verify workflow routing is correct
- Check inactive flag for retired types

Error Handling:
- "Duplicate ID" - Use different Contract Type ID
- "Cannot delete in use" - Mark inactive instead
- "Approval required" - Submit to business process

Screenshot Strategy:
1. List of all contract types
2. Individual contract type details
3. Feature configuration settings
4. Audit findings summary

================================================================================
COMMON CONTRACT TYPE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

| Type ID          | Type Name                  | Features Enabled            |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| STD_GOODS       | Standard Goods Contract    | PO integration, 3-way match |
| STD_SERVICES    | Standard Services Contract | Deliverables, milestones    |
| CONTINGENT      | Contingent Worker Contract | Time tracking, rates        |
| LEASE           | Lease Contract             | Lease amendments, terms     |
| BLANKET_PO      | Blanket Purchase Order     | Multiple POs, catalog       |
| MASTER_SERVICE  | Master Service Agreement   | SOW, change orders          |

================================================================================
RELATED PROCESSES
================================================================================

- Create Supplier Contract -> Uses Contract Type
- Manage Supplier Catalogs -> Links to Contract Type
- Contract Amendments -> Workflow by Contract Type
- Spend Analysis Reports -> Filter by Contract Type
- Supplier Performance -> Categorize by Contract Type

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

1. Define clear naming conventions for contract types
2. Document purpose of each type in Description field
3. Limit number of types to avoid confusion
4. Review and consolidate inactive types periodically
5. Align types with procurement policies
6. Configure appropriate approval workflows per type
7. Train users on when to use each type
8. Audit contract type usage quarterly
9. Archive unused types (mark inactive)
10. Maintain configuration change log

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Contract Types are tenant-level configuration
- Changes affect all future contracts of that type
- Existing contracts retain their original type settings
- Cannot delete types used by existing contracts
- Types can be merged by updating contracts manually
- Report on usage before making changes
- Test configuration changes in sandbox first
