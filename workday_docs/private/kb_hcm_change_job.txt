================================================================================
AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS FOR ELECTRON
================================================================================

1. UI AUTOMATION ANCHORS
   ----------------------
   Key Selectors:
   - Search box: input[data-automation-id="searchBox"]
   - Change Job link: button:contains("Change Job")
   - Worker search: input[data-automation-id="workerSearchBox"]
   - Effective date: input[data-automation-id="dateWidget"]
   - Reason dropdown: select[data-automation-id="promptOption"]
   - Position search: input[data-automation-id="positionSearchWidget"]
   - Manager search: input[data-automation-id="managerSearchWidget"]
   - Submit button: button[data-automation-id="SUBMIT"]

   Navigation Path:
   1. Click search → type "Change Job"
   2. Select business process from results
   3. Search worker by ID or name
   4. Select effective date
   5. Choose change reason
   6. Select or create position
   7. Update job details
   8. Review compensation (if applicable)
   9. Submit for routing

2. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
   ------------------------
   Pre-Submission Checks:
   - Effective date not before hire date
   - Position is either vacant or being created
   - New manager is active employee
   - Compensation within grade range (if applicable)
   - Organization is active
   - Required fields completed

   Business Rule Validations:
   - Cannot transfer to same position
   - Pay cannot decrease on promotion (policy-dependent)
   - Location change may require tax updates
   - Cross-company transfer requires legal entity change
   - Union positions may have transfer restrictions

   Error Handling:
   - "Worker has pending job change" → cancel or wait
   - "Position already filled" → select different position
   - "Invalid effective date" → adjust to future date
   - "Compensation out of range" → adjust pay or override
   - "Missing required approver" → add to approval chain

3. BULK PROCESSING APPROACH
   -------------------------
   For Reorganizations/Mass Transfers:

   Option A: EIB (Recommended for 20+)
   - Use Import_Change_Job spreadsheet
   - Columns: Employee_ID, Effective_Date, New_Position, Reason, New_Manager, etc.
   - Upload via Workday Integration
   - Monitor import status
   - Review errors and resubmit

   Option B: API Loop (Recommended for <20)
   - Call Change_Job SOAP operation
   - Loop through employee list
   - Track business process IDs
   - Monitor approval status
   - Handle errors individually

   Option C: UI Automation (For complex scenarios)
   - Use when creating new positions
   - When compensation changes need review
   - For exceptions requiring manual decisions

4. DATA EXTRACTION NEEDS
   ----------------------
   Input Requirements:
   - Worker ID or Employee ID
   - Effective Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Change Reason Code
   - New Position ID (or position creation data)
   - New Manager Employee ID
   - New Location Code
   - New Organization ID
   - Compensation Change Amount (if applicable)
   - Compensation Change Reason (if applicable)

   Position Creation Data (if new position):
   - Job Profile Code
   - Position Title
   - Organization Code
   - Manager Employee ID
   - Location Code
   - Worker Type
   - Time Type

   Output Data to Capture:
   - Business Process ID
   - Job change confirmation status
   - New position ID (if created)
   - Effective date confirmation
   - Approval chain members
   - Compensation change amount (if applicable)

5. SCREENSHOT STRATEGY
   --------------------
   Critical Screenshots:
   1. Worker current job details (before change)
   2. New position selection/creation
   3. Job details form (organization, location, manager)
   4. Compensation changes (if applicable)
   5. Submission confirmation with BP ID
   6. Approval routing visualization

   Screenshot Timing:
   - Before initiating change (baseline)
   - After position selection
   - Before submitting each sub-process
   - Final confirmation page
   - On any warnings or errors

6. ERROR RECOVERY
   ---------------
   Common Issues:

   Issue: "Position already filled"
   Solution: Check position status, select different position, or create new

   Issue: "Worker has pending job change"
   Solution: Check inbox for pending BP, cancel if duplicate, wait if legitimate

   Issue: "Compensation out of range"
   Solution: Adjust pay to within range, or request override approval

   Issue: "Invalid manager assignment"
   Solution: Verify manager is active, has proper role, not in subordinate chain

   Issue: "Effective date in past"
   Solution: Use current or future date, or request backdated permission

   Issue: "Missing position attribute"
   Solution: Complete all required fields (location, job profile, organization)

7. COMPLEX SCENARIOS
   ------------------
   Scenario: Promotion with Compensation Change
   Steps:
   1. Initiate Change Job
   2. Select higher-level position
   3. System triggers Request Compensation Change sub-process
   4. Enter new salary within grade range
   5. Add compensation approvers to chain
   6. Submit unified business process

   Scenario: Cross-Company Transfer
   Steps:
   1. Initiate Change Job
   2. Select position in different legal entity
   3. System triggers End Employment + Hire sequence
   4. Tax/benefits may reset
   5. Requires additional approvals (legal, finance)
   6. May break service continuity for some benefits

   Scenario: Location Transfer with Relocation
   Steps:
   1. Initiate Change Job with new location
   2. System may trigger "Initiate Relocation" sub-process
   3. Enter relocation details (allowances, temporary housing)
   4. Update tax withholding for new state/country
   5. Change benefits if different location plans

   Scenario: Reorganization (Multiple Employees)
   Steps:
   1. Use EIB for bulk upload
   2. Same effective date for all
   3. Reason: "Organizational Restructure"
   4. Map old org to new org
   5. Assign new managers
   6. Process as batch with single approval chain

8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   -------------------------
   Best Practices:
   - Use SOAP API for bulk transfers (10x faster than UI)
   - Cache organization/position lookups
   - Pre-validate all data before initiating BP
   - Use future effective dates to spread processing
   - Schedule bulk changes during off-peak hours
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Parallel process independent job changes
   - Sequential process when same manager/org

9. COMPLIANCE & AUDIT
   -------------------
   Logging Requirements:
   - Timestamp of each action
   - User initiating change
   - Worker being transferred
   - Effective date
   - Reason for change
   - Old vs new position/org/manager
   - Compensation changes
   - Business Process ID
   - Approval chain completion

   Audit Trail:
   - Screenshot folder: JobChanges/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{EmployeeID}/
   - CSV log: job_changes_log_{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv
   - Export PDF confirmation for each change
   - Retain for 7 years per policy

   Compliance Checks:
   - No discriminatory patterns in transfers
   - Pay equity maintained
   - Promotion criteria met
   - Union notification if required
   - Tax withholding updated

NOTES
================================================================================

- Job changes can be future-dated up to 1 year in advance
- Promotion typically triggers compensation review
- Cross-company transfers may create new hire event (breaks service continuity)
- Location changes may trigger tax withholding updates
- Manager changes update approval delegation automatically
- Historical job data preserved in "Job History" report
- Position can remain vacant after transfer (backfill needed)
- Consider using "Add Additional Job" instead for secondary roles
