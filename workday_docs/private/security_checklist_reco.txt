## Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 (Required)
- Use Bearer Token in Authorization header
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Store Client ID/Secret in secure vault (NOT in code)
- Generate non-expiring refresh tokens for ISUs
- Rotate tokens periodically

## Security Checklist

[ ] Register API clients with appropriate scopes ONLY
[ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 for ALL authentication
[ ] Store secrets in credential vaults, NOT in code
[ ] Enable comprehensive API activity logging
[ ] Conduct regular security audits
[ ] Implement least privilege access
[ ] Monitor for suspicious API usage patterns
[ ] Rotate credentials on schedule
[ ] Validate all API requests/responses
[ ] Use ISUs for automation, NEVER personal accounts

## Access Control

- Assign ONLY permissions strictly necessary (least privilege)
- Create dedicated ISU for EACH integration
- Restrict API client scopes to required functional areas

## Monitoring

- Review API logs regularly for unusual activities
- Implement continuous monitoring of usage patterns
- Set up alerts for:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Unusual data access patterns
  - High volume requests

## Data Protection

- HTTPS required for ALL API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all data inputs/outputs
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
