OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Ledger Accounts in Workday are the fundamental building blocks of the Chart
of Accounts (COA). They represent the categories used to classify financial
transactions and generate financial statements. Workday uses a flat chart
of accounts structure with worktag dimensions for detailed tracking.

Key Concepts:
- Ledger Account: Individual account for recording transactions
- Ledger Account Summary: Grouping of ledger accounts for reporting
- Account Set: Collection of ledger accounts (can be designated as COA)
- Chart of Accounts: Account set designated as primary COA for company
- Worktags: Dimensional attributes that provide transaction detail

Workday COA Philosophy:
Unlike traditional ERP systems with segment-based COAs, Workday uses:
- Flat account structure (no embedded segments)
- Worktag dimensions (Cost Center, Fund, Program, Project, etc.)
- Account summaries for reporting rollups
- Posting rules for dynamic account determination

================================================================================

3. Create summaries before individual accounts
4. Test posting rules thoroughly
5. Review worktag requirements carefully

7. Plan for future account additions
8. Maintain account mapping documentation
9. Regular COA review and cleanup
10. Archive unused/inactive accounts

================================================================================
COMMON ISSUES AND RESOLUTION
================================================================================

Issue: Account not appearing in journal entry
- Check: Account is active
- Check: Account is in company's COA
- Check: User has posting access to account

Issue: Posting rule not determining correct account
- Check: Rule priority/sequence
- Check: Rule conditions match transaction
- Check: Rule set assigned to company

Issue: Summary totals incorrect
- Check: All accounts assigned to summaries
- Check: Summary hierarchy correct
- Check: No duplicate account inclusions

Issue: Cannot create journal to account

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Ledger accounts cannot be deleted if transactions exist
- Account numbers should be unique within COA
- Changes to account type affect historical data presentation
- Consider data conversion when changing COA structure
- Book code affects which accounts are available
- Statistical accounts don't impact financial statements
- Reserve account number ranges for future use
- Document any deviations from standard COA
