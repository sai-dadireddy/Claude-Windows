OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Stocking Locations (also called Inventory Storage Locations) are physical
locations within an Inventory Site where items are stored. They represent
bins, shelves, racks, or other storage areas used to organize and track
inventory. Each Stocking Location belongs to an Inventory Site and can hold
multiple items.

================================================================================
KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

STOCKING LOCATION TYPES:
- Standard Storage Locations: Regular bins/shelves for stock
- Par Locations: Locations with min/max replenishment levels
- Par Bins: Sublevel storage within Par Locations
- Consigned Locations: Supplier-owned inventory storage

STOCKING LOCATION ATTRIBUTES:
- Location ID / Reference
- Inventory Site Association
- Location Name / Description
- Location Type (Standard, Par, Consigned)
- Active/Inactive Status
- On Hold Status (prevents issues from this location)
- Location Hierarchy (zone, aisle, rack, bin)

LOCATION ENABLED OBJECT:
- Inventory_Location_Enabled (used in WSDL operations)
- Contains: Location Reference, Item Reference, Quantity
- Status: Active, On Hold, Inactive
