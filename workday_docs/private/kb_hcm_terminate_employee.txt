================================================================================
WORKDAY SOAP API OPERATIONS
================================================================================

Relevant WSDL: Human_Resources

Key Operations:
1. Get_Workers
   - Retrieve worker details before termination
   - Parameters: Worker_Reference
   - Returns: Full worker profile including employment data

2. Get_Employment_Information
   - Retrieve employment details for termination validation
   - Returns: Position, organization, hire date

3. Terminate_Employee (Business Process via API)
   - Initiate termination through API
   - Required: Worker_Reference, Termination_Date, Termination_Reason
   - Returns: Business Process ID for tracking

4. Get_Former_Worker_Data
   - Retrieve data after termination completion
   - Use for historical reporting
   - Returns: Termination details, final comp, exit data

5. Import_Terminate_Employee (EIB)
   - Bulk termination processing
   - CSV/Excel upload for mass terminations
   - Useful for RIF (Reduction in Force) scenarios

================================================================================
AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS FOR ELECTRON
================================================================================

1. UI AUTOMATION ANCHORS
   ----------------------
   Key Selectors:
   - Search box: input[data-automation-id="searchBox"]
   - Terminate Employee link: button:contains("Terminate Employee")
   - Worker search: input[data-automation-id="workerSearchBox"]
   - Termination date: input[data-automation-id="datePicker"]
   - Reason dropdown: select[data-automation-id="terminationReason"]
   - Submit button: button[data-automation-id="submitButton"]

   Navigation Path:
   1. Click search → type "Terminate Employee"
   2. Select business process from results
   3. Search worker by ID or name
   4. Fill termination details form
   5. Complete sub-processes
   6. Submit for routing

2. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
   ------------------------
   Pre-Submission Checks:
   - Termination date not in past (unless backdated termination)
   - Worker has active employment record
   - No pending business processes for worker
   - Required fields completed (reason, date)
   - Final paycheck date calculated

   Error Handling:
   - "Worker has pending transactions" → wait and retry
   - "Invalid termination date" → adjust to valid date
   - "Missing required field" → identify and populate field
   - "Insufficient security" → verify user has HR Partner access

3. BULK PROCESSING APPROACH
   -------------------------
   For Multiple Terminations:

   Option A: EIB (Recommended for 10+)
   - Use Import_Terminate_Employee spreadsheet
   - Batch upload via Workday Integration
   - Monitor import status
   - Review errors and resubmit

   Option B: API Loop (Recommended for < 10)
   - Call Terminate_Employee SOAP operation
   - Loop through worker list
   - Track business process IDs
   - Monitor approval status
   - Generate completion report

   Option C: UI Automation (Last Resort)
   - Login via Electron browser
   - Loop through worker list
   - Fill form for each worker
   - Screenshot confirmation
   - Export results

4. DATA EXTRACTION NEEDS
   ----------------------
   Input Requirements:
   - Worker ID or Employee ID
   - Termination Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Termination Reason Code
   - Eligible for Rehire (true/false)
   - Additional Comments (optional)

   Output Data to Capture:
   - Business Process ID
   - Termination confirmation status
   - Final paycheck amount
   - PTO payout amount
   - Benefits end date
   - System access termination date

5. SCREENSHOT STRATEGY
   --------------------
   Critical Screenshots:
   1. Worker search result (verify correct worker)
   2. Termination details form (audit trail)
   3. Compensation summary (final pay verification)
   4. Submission confirmation (BP ID visible)
   5. Approval chain (routing visualization)

   Screenshot Timing:
   - Before each major step
   - After successful submission
   - On any error/warning
   - Final confirmation page

6. ERROR RECOVERY
   ---------------
   Common Issues:

   Issue: "Worker not found"
   Solution: Verify employee ID format, try name search

   Issue: "Termination date in past"
   Solution: Check if backdated termination feature enabled

   Issue: "Business process already exists"
   Solution: Check for pending terminations, cancel if needed

   Issue: "Insufficient security"
   Solution: Verify HR Partner or Administrator role assignment

7. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   -------------------------
   Best Practices:
   - Use SOAP API for bulk (faster than UI)
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Batch API calls in groups of 50
   - Use parallel processing for independent terminations
   - Cache worker lookups to reduce API calls
   - Schedule bulk runs during off-peak hours

8. COMPLIANCE & AUDIT
   -------------------
   Logging Requirements:
   - Timestamp of each action
   - User/Service account used
   - Worker ID being terminated
   - Termination date and reason
   - Business Process ID generated
   - Approval chain completion
   - Any errors encountered

   Audit Trail:
   - Save screenshots to structured folder
   - Generate CSV log of all terminations
   - Export PDF of termination confirmation
   - Store for 7 years (per retention policy)

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Termination is IRREVERSIBLE once approved - cannot undo
- For accidental terminations, must use Rehire business process
- Consider using "End Additional Job" for workers with multiple positions
- Backdated terminations require special security access
- Final paycheck timing varies by state (immediate vs next pay cycle)
- COBRA notification is legally required within 30 days
- Worker record moves to "Former Worker" status after termination
- Historical data remains accessible through Get_Former_Worker_Data API
