## Overview

The **Audit Role Assignments** process allows security administrators to review and verify that organization-based role assignments in the tenant are accurate and aligned with security policies. This is a critical audit task for maintaining proper access controls and compliance.

## Key Components

### 1. Purpose of Audit
Auditing role assignments helps organizations:
- Verify role assignments match organizational structure
- Ensure compliance with security policies
- Identify unauthorized or orphaned role assignments
- Support internal and external audits
- Maintain least-privilege access principles

### 2. Organization Roles vs. Security Groups

**Organization Roles:**
- Automatically assigned based on organizational position
- Examples: Manager, HR Partner, Cost Center Manager, Location Manager
- Driven by organizational data (supervisory org, cost center, location)
- Dynamic - change as organization changes

**Security Groups:**
- Manually assigned memberships
- Examples: HR Administrator, Payroll Administrator, System Administrator
- Static assignments requiring manual maintenance
- Used for functional/system access

### 3. Extract Organization Role Assignment Task

This is the primary report/extraction tool for auditing role assignments:
- **Task Name**: "Extract Organization Role Assignment"
- **Output**: CSV/Excel file with all organization role assignments
- **Fields Included**: Worker, Organization, Role, Effective Date, Reason

### 4. Key Audit Areas

**Supervisory Organization Roles:**
- Manager roles for supervisory orgs
- HR Partner assignments
- Recruiter assignments

**Cost Center Roles:**
- Cost Center Manager
