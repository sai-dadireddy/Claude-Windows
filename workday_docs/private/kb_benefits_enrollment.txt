WORKDAY CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Benefits Administration Setup:

1. Benefit Plans: Configure medical, dental, vision, etc.
2. Eligibility Rules: Define who qualifies for each plan
3. Enrollment Periods: Set open enrollment dates
4. Life Events: Define qualifying events

6. Carrier Connections: Integrate with insurance carriers
7. Dependent Verification: Document requirements

================================================================================
AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

UI Automation is NOT recommended for benefit enrollment because:
1. High sensitivity - errors impact employee coverage

Better Approach:
- Guide employees through self-service
- HR reviews and validates elections
