OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Run Payroll process calculates employee earnings, deductions, and taxes for
a specific pay period. This is the core payroll calculation that determines net
pay for each employee. Payroll runs can be regular (scheduled) or off-cycle
(special/ad-hoc payments).

Business Process: Run Pay Calculation / Process Payroll

Typical Duration: 15 minutes - 2 hours (depending on employee count)

Types of Payroll Runs:
- Regular Payroll: Scheduled pay period (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- Off-Cycle Payroll: Bonus, termination final pay, corrections
- Simulation: Test run without committing results
- Retro Payroll: Retroactive adjustments for prior periods

================================================================================

AUTOMATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

UI Selectors:
- Payroll workbench: Search "Payroll Workbench"
- Run calculation: button:contains("Run Pay Calculation")
- Pay group: select[data-automation-id="payGroup"]
- Period dates: input[data-automation-id="datePicker"]
- Submit: button[data-automation-id="SUBMIT"]

Validation:
- All timesheets approved
- Pay period dates valid
- Payment date not in past
- No pending employee changes blocking payroll
- Tax tables current

Error Handling:
- "Timesheet missing" → contact managers
- "Calculation failed" → review error log
- "Tax setup invalid" → fix employee tax records
- "Background process failed" → retry or contact support

Screenshot Strategy:
1. Payroll initiation screen
2. Calculation progress monitor
3. Results summary
4. Exception report (if any)
5. Approval confirmation
6. Settlement confirmation

Performance:
- Use API for initiating scheduled runs
- Monitor via Get_Run_Pay_Calculation
- Use background process for large payrolls
- Schedule during off-peak hours
- Parallel process multiple pay groups
