OVERVIEW
================================================================================

FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) calendars define the work week periods for
overtime calculation purposes. The FLSA requires that overtime be calculated
based on a fixed 7-day work period, which may differ from the pay period.

FLSA calendars are critical for:
- Determining when the 7-day work week starts
- Calculating overtime correctly
- Ensuring compliance with federal labor laws
- Managing different work week starts for different employee groups
