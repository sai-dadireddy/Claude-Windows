OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires Applicable Large Employers (ALEs) to
track employee hours, determine full-time status, and offer minimum essential
coverage to eligible employees. Workday provides comprehensive ACA management
through Measurement Periods, Stability Periods, and automated reporting.

Key ACA Components in Workday:
- ACA Measurement Periods (Initial and Standard)
- ACA Stability Periods
- Affordable Care Reporting Configuration
- 1095-C Form Generation and Transmission
- ACA Worker Hours and Wages Tracking
- ACA Dashboard and Compliance Reports

Applicable Large Employer (ALE) Threshold:
- 50+ full-time equivalent employees
- Full-time = 30+ hours/week or 130+ hours/month

================================================================================
ACA MEASUREMENT PERIODS
================================================================================

1. STANDARD MEASUREMENT PERIOD
   Purpose: Track hours for existing employees to determine FT status

   - Measurement Period End Date
   - Administrative Period (up to 90 days after measurement)
   - Stability Period Start Date (typically 1/1 following year)
   - Stability Period Duration (at least as long as measurement period)

   - Align Initial Measurement with Standard where possible
   - Set Administrative Period to maximum 90 days

2. HOURS TRACKING
   - Integrate time tracking system with Workday
   - Include ALL hours (regular, overtime, on-call)
   - Document hours for variable-hour employees
   - Use equivalencies for non-hourly employees

3. COVERAGE OFFERS
   - Offer coverage before Stability Period starts
   - Document all offers (accepted and declined)
   - Track premium amounts for affordability

4. FORM GENERATION
   - Generate draft forms early (January)
   - Review for accuracy before finalization
   - Distribute to employees by January 31
   - File with IRS by February 28 (paper) or March 31 (electronic)

5. RECORD RETENTION

================================================================================
COMMON ACA SCENARIOS
================================================================================

1. NEW HIRE (Full-Time from Start)
   - Offer coverage within 90 days
   - No measurement period needed
   - 1095-C shows coverage from hire

2. NEW HIRE (Variable Hours)
   - Start Initial Measurement Period
   - Track hours for 3-12 months
   - Determine FT status at end of measurement
   - Offer coverage if FT during Stability Period

3. EMPLOYEE GAINS FT STATUS
   - Hours exceed threshold during measurement
   - Offer coverage during Administrative Period
   - Coverage effective by Stability Period start

4. EMPLOYEE LOSES FT STATUS
   - Hours below threshold during measurement
   - Coverage continues through Stability Period
   - May lose coverage in next Stability Period

5. TERMINATION
   - End coverage on termination date
   - Complete 1095-C for months employed
   - Code 2A for months not employed

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- ACA applies to Applicable Large Employers (50+ FT/FTE employees)
- Measurement Period determines FT status for Stability Period
- Initial Measurement for new hires; Standard for ongoing employees
- Administrative Period allows time to process and offer coverage
- 1094-C is employer transmittal; 1095-C is employee statement
- Electronic filing required for 250+ forms
- State ACA reporting may have additional requirements
- Safe Harbor codes protect against penalties if properly applied
- Keep documentation for at least 7 years
