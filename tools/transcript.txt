[00:00] I built an automatic YouTube system
[00:01] that's saving me hours each and every
[00:03] week whenever I post a new video. I have
[00:06] to do the manual work of coming up with
[00:08] titles, timestamps, a description for
[00:11] the video, and so many other assets. But
[00:14] with this automation using N8, I can
[00:16] click on execute the workflow, enter my
[00:19] video. So let's say I'm going to choose
[00:22] this one here, click on share, copy the
[00:24] link, paste it in, click on submit.
[00:26] automations will run on the back end
[00:28] using a set of my parameters and agents
[00:31] that I've built. And in a matter of
[00:33] seconds, it's come up with some video
[00:35] titles that I could potentially use, a
[00:38] video description based on the criteria
[00:40] and the way that I usually write my
[00:42] descriptions, as well as suggested
[00:44] timestamps and thumbnail ideas,
[00:46] keywords, and email copy that I could
[00:49] simply take away and start promoting
[00:51] that new YouTube video of mine. And this
[00:53] is just one simple automation that I've
[00:55] created to save me hours each and every
[00:58] week. So in this video, I want to share
[00:59] with you 10 useful N and AI agent ideas
[01:03] and workflows that you can build to save
[01:06] you time. Now the first step that you
[01:08] are going to want to take is making sure
[01:10] that you've got access to N8. What I
[01:14] like to do is self-host it. So I've got
[01:16] my own server online on the cloud that
[01:19] runs these automations so that I'm not
[01:21] paying such a premium through n
[01:24] directly. If you head to natn.io,
[01:27] you can see the pricing. Now this is in
[01:30] euros build uh annually. Monthly it
[01:33] looks like this. I'm not sure exactly if
[01:35] I can change the conversion, but that's
[01:37] to give an idea. The way that I like to
[01:39] do it is by self-hosting on a VPS
[01:42] specifically with Hostinger. So it'll be
[01:44] your own server and you can host these.
[01:47] So it's private and no one else shares
[01:49] it with you. There's quite a few plans
[01:51] to choose from. You can see that the
[01:52] pricing differs quite substantially and
[01:55] this is a great way more economic for
[01:57] you in the long run because if you want
[01:59] to save time, become more productive,
[02:01] this is a great way to do it by choosing
[02:03] one of the plans to start off with. So
[02:05] KVM4 is if you want to run automations
[02:08] and don't want any delays doing so, I
[02:11] recommend the KVM4. And once you're on
[02:13] the checkout, after choosing your plan,
[02:15] choose your period. Of course, the more
[02:16] months you go with, the more you will
[02:18] save and go through some of these
[02:20] options here, select the server
[02:22] location. Use the one that's closest to
[02:24] you because this is going to determine,
[02:27] you know, the best latency for you. So,
[02:29] if you're located in the United States,
[02:31] pick one that best suits you since this
[02:33] will all be for personal and private
[02:34] use. All right. So, down the bottom, you
[02:36] see select operating system. You want to
[02:39] choose inn. There's also the init with
[02:42] the plus 100 uh pre-made workflows built
[02:45] in if you do want to choose that.
[02:47] Otherwise, just choose inn and that's
[02:49] what you want to go with. But don't
[02:51] check out yet because I've got a special
[02:53] coupon code that you can use to save
[02:54] further. So, right here, enter in
[02:57] Aurelius. I'll also link hosting and N8
[02:59] in the description box below as well as
[03:01] this coupon code here. Click on apply.
[03:03] That will give you a further discount as
[03:05] you can see. Now, I'm not going to run
[03:07] through the whole setup process, but if
[03:08] you do want to learn how to set it up in
[03:10] Hostinger, I'll link up a relevant video
[03:13] in the description box below. But in
[03:14] this video, as I said, I want to share
[03:16] 10 useful ideas that you can start with
[03:19] and to spark some ideas for you to get
[03:21] started so that you're not left starting
[03:23] from scratch thinking about what sort of
[03:25] automations can I create using NN and
[03:27] creating these AI agents. All right, so
[03:29] the first idea is automated content
[03:32] repurposing. So what can happen is you
[03:34] can post a video on YouTube and then
[03:36] what NN can do is it will transcribe it.
[03:39] Then it generates blog posts, tweets,
[03:41] LinkedIn updates all using chat GBT on
[03:44] the back end and one piece of content
[03:47] really does can fuel the multiple
[03:49] platforms automatically. For example, I
[03:51] found this automation in N8 called
[03:54] automate Instagram content discovery and
[03:56] repurposing. And you can see what it can
[04:00] do. Just to give you a little bit of
[04:02] context on some of the things that it
[04:04] can do, if you look down the bottom on
[04:06] any of these automations, it monitor
[04:08] competitive Instagram accounts,
[04:10] downloads the new res, and processes
[04:12] them without manual intervention. And it
[04:15] does the script generation, duplication,
[04:17] multiplatform intelligence. And by the
[04:19] way, if you do want to take a look at
[04:20] some of the automations that are readily
[04:23] available at N8N, just go to N8N and
[04:26] then we're going to go to templates.
[04:28] There's 5,684 workflow automation
[04:31] templates to choose from. These are some
[04:33] trending ones, but check out this one.
[04:35] We're still talking about idea number
[04:36] one. This is automate multi-platform
[04:38] social media content creation with AI. I
[04:41] simply went to the workflows and search
[04:44] for social media automation. And then
[04:46] this is one of the ones that popped up.
[04:47] Look at this. This is free to use. And
[04:50] if you take a look at this, we're going
[04:51] to zoom in just a little bit. You know,
[04:54] it's quite comprehensive, right? But
[04:55] just to zoom out like this is the
[04:57] complexity that is involved with this
[05:00] automation and this can be quite
[05:02] overwhelming especially if you don't
[05:03] know how to set up your first AI agent
[05:05] but start with what you only need and
[05:08] then you can kind of progress from there
[05:10] in my opinion. So down the bottom
[05:12] there's always like this description
[05:14] social media managers and digital
[05:15] marketers seeking to streamline content
[05:17] production across seven plus platforms.
[05:20] So quite impressive there and the best
[05:22] part is it's free but that's just one
[05:24] idea. If this is something that's taking
[05:26] you a lot of time, let's say you're
[05:27] posting on YouTube, but then you want to
[05:29] repurpose that content and post it onto
[05:31] other platforms, this is a great way to
[05:33] do it using N. By the way, in order to
[05:35] use any of the workflows in N, all you
[05:39] need to do is head to your hosting VPN,
[05:42] create a new workflow, and you'll have
[05:44] this blank canvas. So, once you found
[05:47] one, click on use. What you can do then
[05:50] is copy the template to clipboard. And
[05:53] this is just one of the multiple ways
[05:55] that you can do it. And then all you
[05:57] need to do on your keyboard is paste it
[05:59] in. So on my Mac, it's commandV. And
[06:03] there we go. We've got the entire
[06:04] workflow ready to go. And all we need to
[06:08] do now is fill in the details. So if you
[06:11] haven't connected your Google account,
[06:12] for instance, then you're going to want
[06:14] to do that so that it has access
[06:16] essentially to your Google account and
[06:19] your OpenAI. So it really depends which
[06:21] workflow you are using from N8N. The
[06:25] next idea is scraping business emails
[06:27] from Google maps without the use of any
[06:30] third party APIs. And this is the
[06:33] specific automation that I found in N8N
[06:36] and it does exactly what name suggests.
[06:39] It will scrape the emails rather than
[06:41] going to each and every business listing
[06:43] on Google maps and then you copy and
[06:45] pasting every single email to contact
[06:47] them. So rather than that you can create
[06:49] this automation that does it all for
[06:51] you. And as mentioned you don't need any
[06:53] third-party APIs that you need to plug
[06:56] into N8N. The third ID is also social
[06:58] media related but with this if you're
[07:00] currently using let's say Google Sheets
[07:03] or Excel or notion what you can do is
[07:06] you can batch schedule posts in those
[07:09] apps and let N autopublish them to
[07:12] places like X LinkedIn and Instagram.
[07:15] So, it's a must have if you're, you
[07:17] know, you want to stay consistent with
[07:18] branding without juggling multiple apps.
[07:21] And this doesn't necessarily have to be
[07:23] in Notion or Google Sheets, but I think
[07:25] that's just a simple way since most of
[07:27] you are probably using Notion or Excel
[07:29] yourself. So, import everything into
[07:31] notion and then create an automation
[07:33] that will automatically post all those
[07:36] onto those platforms. All right. The
[07:38] next idea is to create like a daily
[07:40] business dashboard. So each morning you
[07:42] get a single summary of you know your
[07:44] emails. You get a Slack message with
[07:47] sales from Stripe or your PayPal
[07:49] account. You get also a little
[07:51] notification or a section where you can
[07:53] see new subscribers of yours on places
[07:56] like YouTube, on Instagram, on your
[07:58] email marketing platform. So at one
[08:00] glance, you know, on your platform, you
[08:02] can see everything without logging to
[08:05] dozens or you know multiple platforms in
[08:08] at once. So every morning check that one
[08:10] dashboard and you've got everything
[08:12] there. All this can be automated using
[08:14] N. Idea number five is to create an AI
[08:17] agent so that you're creating like this
[08:19] content idea inbox. So every time you
[08:23] voice note let's say on your phone you
[08:25] can run an automation. So you can
[08:26] actually hook up WhatsApp or Telegram
[08:28] and then when you create a voice message
[08:31] in it and can then transcribe it, send
[08:33] it to your content ideas page or
[08:36] workspace or database in your notion
[08:39] account or whatever platform that you
[08:41] organize all your things and that way no
[08:45] ideas get lost. So there are plenty of
[08:47] times when I think about an idea. I'm
[08:49] like ah just need something where I can
[08:51] just quickly voice something and then
[08:52] that will automatically put it into my
[08:55] project management workspace. You know
[08:57] what if something existed then this is a
[09:00] great solution right by using the power
[09:01] of N8 and you simply voice chat on
[09:04] WhatsApp or whatever communication and
[09:06] chat program you use and then that
[09:08] automatically stores it to your favorite
[09:11] project management system. The next idea
[09:13] is an AI agent for idea validation. So
[09:16] every time you add a video idea to again
[09:19] your favorite project management system
[09:21] such as notion in it and then runs it
[09:24] through GPT or chargbt to score it on
[09:28] like let's say search potential tension
[09:31] hook and monetization fit whether it's
[09:34] viable as an idea and then helps you
[09:36] prioritize the best ideas fast. So
[09:39] rather than doing all the guesswork, you
[09:41] can simply enter your idea and then
[09:43] it'll run through all these criteria and
[09:45] then give you the green lights or the
[09:46] red light. This is a good idea or not a
[09:49] good idea or something that can just be
[09:51] put on the back burner. Okay, idea
[09:52] number seven is creating like a news
[09:54] aggregator or something where each and
[09:57] every day on a daily basis they send you
[09:59] the latest news which is one great use
[10:01] of NN really. So, in the NetN workflows
[10:04] section, you can say something like uh
[10:07] news and then you'll find a list of
[10:10] workflows that you could potentially use
[10:12] to do that. Let's be more specific and
[10:15] say news headlines. We've got a couple
[10:18] here. And let's say you are a regular
[10:21] reader of Hacker News, right? And
[10:23] there's quite a few here. Hacker News to
[10:25] video content. Not quite what we want
[10:27] but you can do other things like get
[10:29] data from hacker news and send it to air
[10:32] table or via SMS. So these kinds of
[10:34] things that you can do to aggregate you
[10:37] know gather all those news especially if
[10:39] you're in the field where you're posting
[10:41] content about the latest things about in
[10:43] your industry. So this is extremely
[10:45] useful or if you just want to you know
[10:47] feed your knowledge with what's
[10:49] happening today. Number eight is
[10:50] automatic Gmail email labeling. And a
[10:54] lot of emails probably going into your
[10:56] inbox and it's not sorted. It's not
[10:58] organized. So, a great way to do it is
[11:01] by creating an automation that
[11:02] automatically categorizes and labels it
[11:04] all using the power of AI. You can see
[11:06] how the automation works. And who's this
[11:08] for? It's an inbox. It's for those with
[11:11] an inbox full of unread emails. And
[11:13] instead of reading through them one by
[11:15] one, uh you can let AI do the sorting.
[11:18] And here's how it works. So every hour
[11:20] the workflow runs automatically such as
[11:22] for unread emails and then what it does
[11:24] is it extracts the content and sends it
[11:26] to open AI. Then the AI returns one of
[11:29] four labels action receipt. So all of
[11:31] these automations that you find in the
[11:33] workflows and the templates do work
[11:35] differently depending on what you want.
[11:36] But the great thing with inn is it's
[11:38] completely flexible to you know however
[11:41] you choose like however you want the
[11:43] automation to work. but use it as a
[11:46] starting ground and personalize it based
[11:48] on the activities that you use it for
[11:51] and for your daily process. All right,
[11:53] number nine. This one's a great one.
[11:54] Extract and store YouTube video comments
[11:57] in Google Sheets. And if you're doing a
[12:00] bit of research into and wanting to know
[12:03] what do my audience seek, what are their
[12:06] problems, what are they facing, so that
[12:08] I could potentially create a new video
[12:10] on those subjects or I could potentially
[12:13] create an offer or a product or a
[12:14] digital product that solves that
[12:17] problem. You can do it all using this
[12:19] particular and free init workflow. All
[12:23] right, so this init template
[12:25] demonstrates how to use the tool and
[12:26] here's how it works. The workflow starts
[12:28] when you manually click test flow. Uh it
[12:31] reads the list of YouTube video URLs
[12:33] from the YouTube from the video URLs and
[12:36] then it reads the comments, puts it into
[12:39] Google sheet and the great thing about
[12:41] these automations is that it does give
[12:43] you a set of instructions and what you
[12:45] need uh prerequisites before you
[12:47] actually get started. The great thing
[12:49] about initiards
[12:52] of actually creating the AI agent, the
[12:54] rest is quite passive. It runs on the
[12:56] back end whenever you need it. And
[12:58] finally, number 10. This one is also
[13:00] kind of news related, but if you're,
[13:02] let's say, getting on a call with a
[13:05] client or a company, this one scrapes
[13:07] recent news about a company before a
[13:10] call. So, it may be a really important
[13:12] call for you. Let's say an interview or
[13:15] you're working with a new client and you
[13:18] want to build trust. This is a great way
[13:21] because it's going to scrape uh the web
[13:23] for news, recent news about that company
[13:26] and then it'll give you a summary of all
[13:28] those things. So these again are the
[13:30] steps and this is how the automation
[13:33] looks. But to give you an idea, it gets
[13:35] a meeting for today. It has some filters
[13:38] in place, extracts the company name, the
[13:42] news, and then it formats the email so
[13:45] that it sends it ultimately via email so
[13:48] that you get a gist of everything that
[13:50] you need to learn about that company and
[13:52] the latest news of course in your email.
[13:54] And that's just a fraction of the kinds
[13:56] of NAN automations that you can build
[13:58] using N8 and Hostinger on your own
[14:01] server. I'll list all of these workflows
[14:03] that I found in the description box
[14:05] below. hosting a link will be in
[14:07] description box below so you can sign
[14:08] up, create your own N server and get
[14:11] started. But hopefully that sparked some
[14:13] ideas to create your own AI agents. I'll
[14:15] link up this video right here that will
[14:18] guide you on how I actually set up my
[14:20] own YouTube automation system. So I'll
[14:23] see you there.
